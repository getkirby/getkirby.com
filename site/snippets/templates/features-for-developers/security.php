		<p>Kirby 3 is built on a modern, secure stack with state-of-the-art PHP and Vue.js at its core. We follow OWASP standards closely for everything we build. Our file-based architecture eliminates one of the main attack vectors of content management systems – SQL injections. Kirby can easily be set up to run without an admin interface or external API for even tighter security on your production server.
