# Kirby website

This repo contains the whole <getkirby.com> website.

## Requirements

- Local development server running PHP 7.3+ (e.g. Apache, nginx, MAMP).
- Node.js 10+ (LTS release) + NPM

## Installation and setup

### Step 1: Clone the repo into an empty folder

```
git clone git@github.com:getkirby/getkirby.com.git
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Step 3: Configuration

We are using [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/mix) as our build tool,
which also provides BrowserSync for an optimal developer experience. By default,
it expects a copy of the site to run at `http://getkirby.test`. The document root
of the site is the subfolder `www/`.

You can override the default domain if you prefer to run the site
at a different domain. To do so, just copy `config.default.json` to a file
named `config.json`. You can define a custom domain that new file.

## Start the build tool for development

```
cd [root folder of this repo]
npm start
```

This will run BrowserSync and watch your CSS, JS and template files for changes.

Stop the server by pressing `CRTL+C` or by closing the CLI window.

## Build for production

Before committing anything back to the repo, make sure to run a production build,
as our server does not build assets by itself. Itâ€™s always a good idea to lint
your code, before committing anything to the repo. You can do so, by running the
dedicated lint task:

```
npm run lint
```

If the linters do not produce any errors, you can create a production build, as
follows:

```
npm run build
```

## Linters

Our site uses `eslint` and `stylelint` for keeping the contents of JS and SCSS
files consistent. It is highly recommended that you intall the corresponding
integration plugin for your editor or IDE. If your development tool of choice
does not offer the corresponding integration, you can alternatively run the
linters manually before commiting anything back to the repository, by executing:

```
npm run lint
```
