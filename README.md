# Kirby website

This repo contains the whole <getkirby.com> website.

## Requirements

- Local development server running PHP 7.3+ (e.g. Apache, nginx, MAMP).
- Node.js 10+ (LTS release) + NPM

## Installation and setup

### Step 1: Clone the repo into an empty folder

```
git clone git@github.com:getkirby/getkirby.com.git
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Step 3: Configuration

We are using [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/mix) as our build tool,
which also provides BrowserSync for an optimal developer experience. By default,
it expects a copy of the site to run at `http://getkirby.test`. The document root
of the site is the subfolder `www/`.

You can override the default domain if you prefer to run the site
at a different domain. To do so, just copy `config.default.json` to a file
named `config.json`. You can define a custom domain that new file.

## Start the build tool for development

```
cd [root folder of this repo]
npm start
```

This will run BrowserSync and watch your CSS, JS and template files for changes.

Stop the server by pressing `CRTL+C` or by closing the CLI window.

## Build for production

Before committing anything back to the repo, make sure to run a production build,
as our server does not build assets by itself. It’s always a good idea to lint
your code, before committing anything to the repo. You can do so, by running the
dedicated lint task:

```
npm run lint
```

If the linters do not produce any errors, you can create a production build, as
follows:

```
npm run build
```

## Linters

Our site uses `eslint` and `stylelint` for keeping the contents of JS and SCSS
files consistent. It is highly recommended that you intall the corresponding
integration plugin for your editor or IDE. If your development tool of choice
does not offer the corresponding integration, you can alternatively run the
linters manually before commiting anything back to the repository, by executing:

```
npm run lint
```

## Visual regression tests

When refactoring and style sheets or for testing how any change will affect the
site appearance, you are encouraged to use the integrated backstop testing. First
of all, you have to create a local configuration. To generate the tests, run:

```
npm run backstop-config
````

This will create a file called `backstop.json` within your project root. To
generate reference screenshots of the site, run:

```
npm run backstop-reference
```

After your reference has been generated (this will take a while), make your
changes to to any CSS file, template or anything else that could affect page
appearance. Now, run:

```
npm run backstop-test
```

This will generate a second set of screenshots. Backstop will compare these to
the reference set of screenshots and open a report in your browser after the
process has finished, allowing you to revisit every change.

To open the report again, run:

```
npm run backstop-report
```

The testing scenarios for Backstop are defined in `site/plugins/backstop/index.php`,
in case you want to add a new template and add a page where it’s acutally used
to the scenarios.
