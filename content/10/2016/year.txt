## Fabian

While I started as a professional designer, I lost more and more track of the design world with my focus on programming. I discovered (link: https://fabianmichael.de/ text: Fabian’s design work) through his Kirby projects and instantly liked his style. It was an obvious choice to ask him to help me out. He developed a new color system for us and worked extensively on the website for Kirby 3.

## First Kosmos issue

Sonja found tons of interesting community projects through her moderation work in the forum. It was a shame that it all got lost in there and that there wasn't a better platform to highlight those projects. That's how the idea to start a regular (link: kosmos text: newsletter) emerged.

Sonja turned Kosmos into way more than just a Kirby community newsletter. Every month, she surprises us again with super interesting design and development resources. With more than 60 issues, this newsletter has become an integral part of Kirby.
