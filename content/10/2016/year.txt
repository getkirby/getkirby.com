## Nico & Fabian

More and more work for v2 piled up. We didn't have a proper CI workflow and tests back in those days and every release was an adventure. It got clear that we need to invest more in a professional setup. Nico was another frequent member of the community, who had built some very impressive projects with Kirby. I asked him to help us out with frontend work for the Panel and other parts of the system. Over the years we had endless experimental coding sessions together and built some really cool things that sometimes even ended up in releases ðŸ˜„

While I started as a professional designer, I lost more and more track of the design world with my focus on programming. I discovered Fabianâ€™s design work through his Kirby projects and instantly liked his style. It was an obvious choice to ask him to help me out. He developed a new color system for us and worked extensively on the website for Kirby 3.

## First Kosmos issue

Sonja found tons of interesting community projects through her moderation work in the forum. It was a shame that it all got lost in there and that there wasn't a better platform to highlight those projects. That's how the idea came up to start a regular newsletter.

Sonja turned Kosmos into way more than just a Kirby community newsletter. Every month, she surprises us again with super interesting design and development resources. With more than 60 issues, this newsletter has become an integral part of Kirby.
