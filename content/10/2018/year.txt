## A year in limbo

After announcing Kirby Next in Summer 2017, everyone was waiting for the new version. We expected to get it out there in early 2018, but it turned into our vaporware horror story. By the beginning of the new year we were not even half done. While we made amazing progress in the first months, we ran into one conceptional problem after the other.

Sales dropped. Why would you buy a v2 license when v3 is just around the corner? But it wasn't around the corner. Not even close.

The crowdfunding budget shrinked and shrinked. We tried to communicate openly, but it didn't help much. It was a tough year and the pressure was extremely high. While the Kirby Next group was one of the best things that ever happened to us, the way we announced Kirby Next and the plans for v3 where one of our biggest mistakes.
