Title: Permissions

----

Intro: User permissions help you to restrict access and capabilities for specific user roles â€“ in the (glossary: Panel) as well as when using Kirby's (link: docs/guide/templates/php-api text: PHP API) or (link: docs/guide/api/authentication text: REST API).

## Defining permissions

Permissions in Kirby are defined in two optional steps:

1. In a user blueprints for each role
2. In the page, file or the site blueprints for more explicit rules

### User blueprint

Each role can get its own blueprint with custom fields for users with that role and an additional setup for user permissions. User blueprints are stored in `/site/blueprints/users` and get the name of each role (i.e `/site/blueprints/users/editor.yml`).

Permissions can only be added for custom roles. The admin role does not obey those settings and can always do anything.

An overview on all available permissions:

```yaml "/site/blueprints/users/editor.yml"
title: Editor
permissions:
  access:
    panel: true
    site: true
    settings: false
  files:
    create: true
    changeName: true
    delete: true
    replace: true
    update: false
  site:
    update: false
  pages:
    create: true
    changeTemplate: true
    changeTitle: true
    changeSlug: true
    hide: true
    sort: true
    update: true
    delete: false
  user:
    create: false
    createAvatar: true
    deleteAvatar: false
    changeName: false
    changeEmail: false
    changePassword: false
    changeRole: false
    delete: false
    update: false
  users: false
```

You don't have to set all of those permissions for each role though. Each permission is set to true by default, if not specified otherwise. You can also enable or disable entire sections by passing `true` or `false` instead of an array of definitions for each action. A more simple permission setup for an editor could be something like this:

```yaml "/site/blueprints/users/editor.yml"
title: Editor
permissions:
  site:
    update: false
  pages:
    delete: false
  users: false
  user:
    changeRole: false
```

This would prevent the editor from editing other users, from changing their own role, from deleting pages and from updating the site settings.

## The `*` wildcard

For parts with many actions that get the same setting, you can use the * wildcard as first argument. Afterwards you can still override specific actions, for example to whitelist actions:

```yaml
user:
  *: false
  changeName: true
```

## Visitors

Frontend users can also be managed through the Panel, but you most likely don't want them to be able to access the Panel at all. In order to achieve this, set Panel access to `false`.

```yaml
title: Visitor
permissions:
  access:
    panel: false
```

If you use any of Kirby's (link: docs/guide/templates/php-api text: PHP APIs) in the frontend to modify pages, files, the site or users, you should set the permissions like above to control what a visitor can do in your frontend. You can also have multiple frontend user roles without access to the Panel but with different access to the PHP APIs. Our (link: docs/guide/api/authentication text: REST API) follows the same rules.

## Getting more specific

You can keep all the permissions in the role files, but you can also overwrite them individually per page, file, user or the site in their blueprints. Those specific permission settings will always override the role settings.

### Page options


```yaml "/site/blueprints/pages/project.yml"
title: Project

options:
  changeTemplate: false
  changeTitle: false
  update: true
  delete: false
```
## Even more control with hooks

If the blueprint-based permission settings are too limiting for your project, you can get more flexibility by creating your own permission checks with `before` hooks for various actions.

```php "/site/config/config.php"

return [
  'hooks' => [
    'page.delete:before' => function (Page $page) {
      if ($this->user()->email() !== 'overlord@ourcompany.com') {
        throw new Exception('Only our overlord and savior can delete pages');
      }
    }
  ]
];
```

Of course this can get way more complex and sophisticated than that, but it's a good first start.

## Authenticate or impersonate

To obtain the required permissions for certain actions, you can  authenticate as a user via logging in. If you want to run some actions programmatically without logging in, there is also the option to impersonate.

### Authentication

Users can log in through the (glossary: Panel) login page or any custom login form. To learn more about how to log in a user programmatically, read the reference for (link: docs/reference/objects/user/login text: $user->login()).

### Impersonate

One way to go without authentication is to (link: docs/reference/objects/kirby/impersonate text: impersonate) any user or the special `kirby` super user, which has full permissions:

```php
<?php

$kirby = kirby();
$kirby->impersonate('kirby');

page('notes/a-great-article')->update([
  'author'  => 'Homer Simpson'
]);
```

The impersonation will only last for the current request.
