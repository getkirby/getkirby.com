## User options

On the "Users" page, click on the option icon next to the user to open the dropdown with options for the user.

## Rename user

Users are identified by their email address by default, but you can also assign a more recognizable name. That can be a full name or just a nick name. It's up to you and your team.

## Change user password

Passwords must be at least 8 characters long. Make them as strong as possible! We recommend 32+ characters, highly random passwords and a password manager to keep track of them.
