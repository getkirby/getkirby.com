Title: Installation issues

----

Intro: We try our best to make the installation of Kirby as effortless as possible, but with multiple server setups and PHP versions, there's unfortunately always space for problems.

Text:

## Broken subpages

Your homepage is working great, but subpages won't open or lead to a server error?

1. Make sure that the `.htaccess` file that ships with Kirby is present in your Kirby folder.
2. Check if `mod_rewrite` is enabled on your server (Apache).
3. Check if the `.htaccess` file gets loaded. You can test this by putting some nonsense characters into your `.htaccess`. If this triggers an "Internal Server Error", the file gets loaded. Otherwise, you need to enable `AllowOverride all` in your Apache configuration.
4. Please try setting the `RewriteBase` in the `.htaccess` file:

```
RewriteBase /
```

If you run Kirby in a subfolder, make sure to set the RewriteBase according to the name of your subfolder:

```
RewriteBase /my-subfolder
```

## Thumbs not generated, Panel not working

If you use PHP's built-in server (not recommended), you have to start it up with Kirby's router:

```php
php -S localhost:8000 kirby/router.php
```

## Weird PHP syntax errors

Please make sure that you use the minimum required version of PHP, which is 7.1+ since Kirby 3.0.0. We recommend using the most recent stable PHP version that is available to you.

## Issues with date & time handling

Check if you have set the (link: https://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php text: correct timezone) in your `php.ini` file with the `date.timezone` option. If you don't have access to the `php.ini` file, check if your hosting provider allows changing this in their web interface, otherwise contact your hosting provider.

## Subpages and files not working

Check your file and folder permissions. Files should be 644, folders 755.

## Broken data after saving

Your content files seem to be corrupted after you tried to save a page in the Panel? Make sure the PHP `mb_string` extension is installed on your server. A missing extension leads to broken data in text files.

## Error 500 when trying to access Panel

Make sure that the PHP `mb_string` extension is installed/enabled.
