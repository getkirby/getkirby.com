Title: Query Language

----

Intro: Kirby 3 comes with a blueprint query language that offers basically the same functionality as Kirby's PHP API with a simple dot notation.

## Introduction

The query language adds a lot of flexibility when querying options for select, radio  and checkboxes fields, for querying collections in Panel sections and to manipulate how information is displayed in the Panel.

If you are not familiar with (link: docs/guide/templates/php-api text: Kirby's PHP API) yet, you should learn more about it first. The query language is very close to it and will be confusing without the basics.

### Syntax

#### PHP

```php
$site->title()
$page->title()->lower()
$page->children()
$page->children()->filterBy('featured', true)
```

#### Query

```txt
site.title
page.title.lower
page.children
page.children.filterBy('featured', true)
```

As you can see, it is very close to the PHP syntax. You don't need to relearn anything this way.

<info>
The query language is not limited to built-in methods. You can also use (glossary: model text: page models) and custom methods within your queries.

### Blueprint example

There are two ways of using the query language in your blueprints.

#### 1. To fetch data

In this example we use the query language to fetch options for a select field. You can fetch any collection of pages, files or users to be used as options.

```yaml
# select field
mySelect:
  label: My Select Box
  type: select
  options: query
  query: site.children.listed
```

#### 2. To create string templates

Another way to use the language is to create custom information for page or file lists. In this case we use the query language as part of our template syntax.

```yaml
# pages section
published:
  headline: Published Pages
  type: pages
  info: "Year: {{ page.year }}"
```

## Querying options in radio, checkboxes and select fields or tags

```yaml
tags:
    label: Tags
    type: tags
    options: query
    query:
      fetch: page.siblings
      text: " {{ page.title}}"
      value: " {{ page.uri}}"

mySelect:
  label: My Select Box
  type: select
  options: query
  query: site.children.listed

```

Check out the (link: docs/reference/panel/fields text: docs for each of these fields in the Reference).


## Querying the parent in pages sections

```yaml
sections:
  articles:
    type: pages
    headline: Blog Articles
    parent: site.find("blog")
```
## Querying files in files sections

```yaml
sections:
  gallery:
    headline: Images
    type: files
    query: page.images
```


## Querying an image in the image option

```yaml

image:
  query: page.images.template("cover").first
  ratio: 1/1
  cover: true
```

## Querying information to display in the info option of an item

```yaml

info: "{{ page.from.toDate('d.m.Y') }} - {{ page.to.toDate('d.m.Y') }} / {{ page.location }}"

info: "{{ file.dimensions }}"
```
