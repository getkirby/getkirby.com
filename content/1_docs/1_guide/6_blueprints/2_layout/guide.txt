Title: Layout
----

Intro: With blueprints you can create highly customized layouts that display the perfect interface for any type of data.

A blueprint layout is made up of columns, and each column can hold any number of sections. Kirby ships with the following section types:

(reference: panel/sections)

You can combine those section types in any way you like and also use multiple sections with the same type in a single blueprint layout.

For one page type you might need a list of all subpages, files and a few form elements, whereas for the next page type you just need subpages or a gallery. With sections, all this is possible.

## Defining columns

Columns can be defined in two ways:

### Named columns

```yaml
title: My blueprint

columns:
  left:
    width: 2/3
    sections:
      # sections in the left column
  right:
    width: 1/3
    sections:
      # sections in the right column
```

### Unnamed columns

```yaml
title: My blueprint

columns:
  - width: 2/3
    sections:
      # sections in the left column
  - width: 1/3
    sections:
      # sections in the right column
```

<info>
If you want to extend columns, you have to use named columns.

The following widths are available when defining columns:
`1/2`, `1/3`, `1/4`, `2/3`, `2/4`, `3/4`

## Adding sections
Once you have set up your base column layout, the fun part begins and you can now add some sections.

```yaml
title: My blueprint

columns:
  # main
  main:
    width: 2/3
    sections:

      # a simple form
      content:
        type: fields
        fields:
          headline:
            label: Headline
            type: text
          text:
            label: Text
            type: textarea

  # sidebar
  sidebar:
    width: 1/3
    sections:

      # a list of subpages
      pages:
        type: pages
        headline: Subpages

      # a list of files
      files:
        type: files
        headline: Files
```

### Result

(screenshot: columns-screen-1.png)

You can probably already see how flexible this is. By slightly changing the columns, we can change the interface drastically.

### Sidebar on the left

```yaml
title: My blueprint

columns:

  # sidebar
  sidebar: 
    width: 1/3
    sections:
      # a list of subpages …
      # a list of files …

  # main
  main:
    width: 2/3
    sections:
      # a simple form …
```
(screenshot: columns-screen-2.png)

### Two Sidebars

```yaml
title: My blueprint

columns:

  # sidebar left
  sidebar_left:
    width: 1/4
    sections:
      # a list of subpages …

  # main
  main: 
    width: 2/4
    sections:
      # a simple form …

  # sidebar right
  sidebar_right:
    width: 1/4
    sections:
      # a list of files …
```

## Single-column layouts

(picture: sections.png)

If you don't need multiple columns, you can keep your blueprint a lot shorter by using the `sections` option instead of defining columns. This will automatically create a single-column layout for you, where all sections are listed below each other.

```yaml
title: My blueprint

sections:
  drafts:
    type: pages
    headline: Drafts
    status: draft
  published:
    type: pages
    headline: Published pages
    status: listed
```

## Just some fields

(picture: fields.png)

Some blueprint types don't even need sections at all and a simple form is enough. In this case you can make your blueprints even shorter and add the fields definition directly without defining sections or columns.

```yaml
title: My blueprint

fields:
  headline:
    label: Headline
    type: text
  text:
    label: Text
    type: textarea
```

## Adapt all to your needs

(picture: columns-complex.png)

Kirby gives you the flexibility to set up the (glossary: Panel), so that it adapts to the needs of every single page/template. Use the layout possibilities to create the structure that works best for you:

```yaml
title: My blueprint

columns:
  gallery:
    width: 1/1
    sections:
      gallery:
        type: files
        layout: card
        ...

  review:
    width: 1/2
    sections:
      drafts:
        type: pages
        status: draft
        ...
      review:
        type: pages
        status: unlisted
        ...

  published:
    width: 1/2
    sections:
      published:
        type: pages
        status: listed
        ...
```
