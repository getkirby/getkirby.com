Title: Fields

----

Intro: No matter if you use presets or create your own layouts, form fields are an essential part of the configuration and have very powerful options.

Text:

## Available form fields

(reference: panel/fields)

## Custom fields

You can extend this list with your own field types by creating a (link: docs/reference/plugins/extensions/fields text: field plugin).

## Naming fields

You can choose the names for your fields freely, but there are two limitations:

1. You can only use alphanumeric characters and underscores in field names.
2. If you use field names that are reserved by native Kirby methods, your field names will conflict. For example, if you give your field the name "image", it will conflict with Kirby's `$page->image()` method. You can still use this field name, but you will have to call such a field via the `$page->content()->image()` method. We recommend prefixing your field names instead.
