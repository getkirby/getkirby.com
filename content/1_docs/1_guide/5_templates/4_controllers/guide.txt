Title: Controllers

Subtitle: Separate the logic of pages from their presentation

Intro: Templates should contain as little code as possible to separate logic and form. With template controllers you can add more logic to your templates without messing up your markup.

Text:

## TL;DR

- Use a controller for the logic of your templates.
- A controller must have the same file name as the corresponding template file.
- Save controllers in `/site/controllers`.

## The controllers directory

Controllers go into `/site/controllers`. Create the directory if it's not there yet. Controllers are named exactly like the templates they belong to:

Template | Controller
-        | -
`/site/templates/article.php` | `/site/controllers/article.php`


Kirby will automatically load the controller for your template if it can find one.

## Default controller

You can also have a default page controller: It works like a normal page controller. You only have to add it as `/site/controllers/site.php`. Be aware that the default controller only works as a fallback if no specific page controller for the template exists. It is *not* loaded in addition to the template-specific one.

## Creating a controller

The basic code for a controller is very simple. It's an anonymous function that should return the variables that you want to pass to the template as an associative array.

```php
<?php

return function () {
  return [
    'foo' => 'my first template variable',
    'bar' => 'my second template variable'
  ];
};
```
In this case the `$foo` and `$bar` variables will be available in the corresponding template.

## Accessing Kirby objects in your controller

Like in templates, you can access the `$site`, `$page`, `$pages` and `$kirby` objects by loading them as arguments to the anonymous function. Kirby will magically inject the right objects for you:

### A single object

```php
return function ($page) {
	// do something with the page
};
```

### Multiple objects

```php
return function ($page, $site, $kirby) {
	// do something with the page, site and kirby
};
```

### Order doesn't matter

```php
return function ($site, $page, $kirby) {
	// do something with the page, site and kirby
};
```

## A real world example

A typical example where a controller can come in handy is a blog template. Fetching the right articles can take a couple lines of code and it's much nicer to wrap these in a controller. So let's create `/site/templates/blog.php` and `/site/controllers/blog.php`

### The controller

The controller will take care of fetching the right articles and add pagination to them. It will then pass the `$articles` and `$pagination` variables to the template to keep it clean.

```php "/site/controllers/blog.php"
<?php

return function ($page) {

  // get all articles
  $articles = $page->children()->listed()->flip();

  // add a tag filter
  if ($tag = get('tag')) {
    $articles = $articles->filterBy('tags', '=', $tag, ',');
  }

  // add pagination
  $articles = $articles->paginate(20);

  // create a shortcut for pagination
  $pagination = $articles->pagination();

  // pass $articles and $pagination to the template
  return [
    'articles' => $articles,
    'pagination' => $pagination
  ];

};
```
## The template

With such a controller, the template can be super clean. A foreach loop for the articles and the prev/next pagination and you're done.

```php "/site/templates/blog.php"
<?php snippet('header') ?>

<?php foreach ($articles as $article): ?>
<?php snippet('article', ['article' => $article]) ?>
<?php endforeach ?>

<nav class="pagination">

  <?php if ($pagination->hasPrevPage()): ?>
  <a href="<?= $pagination->prevPageUrl() ?>">previous articles</a>
  <?php endif ?>

  <?php if ($pagination->hasNextPage()): ?>
  <a href="<?= $pagination->nextPageUrl() ?>">next articles</a>
  <?php endif ?>

</nav>

<?php snippet('footer') ?>
```

## Arguments from the router

If you work with additional routes and you want to access the arguments from the router in your controller, you can use Kirby's `route()` method to access an array of router arguments.

```php
<?php

return function ($kirby) {

  $args = $kirby->route()->arguments();
	// contains all arguments from the current route

};
```


## Arguments from `$page->render()` in route

<since v="3.1.3">
When using the [`$page->render()`](/docs/reference/objects/page/render) method to return a page in a route, you can send an array of additional data with it:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
    'routes' => [
        [
            'pattern' => 'blog/tag/(:any)',
            'action' => function ($value) {
                $data = [
                  'tag' => $value,
                ];
                return page('blog')->render($data);
            }
        ]
    ]
];
```

In the controller, you can load each variable that you passed to the `render()` method in the route into the controller's anonymous function and then work with it.

```php
<?php

return function ($page, $tag) {

  $articles = $page->children()->listed();

    if ($tag) {
        $articles = $articles->filterBy('tags', $tag, ',');
    }

    return [
        'articles' => $articles
    ];

};
```

<info>
The properties defined in the `$data` array are exposed to **templates** as global variables, so in use cases where you **do not** need them in a controller, you can use them directly.
