## Where to go from here

Now that you have successfully installed Kirby on your server, it's time to explore your new Kirby installation. So get yourself a cup of coffee or tea (or whatever else you like most) and head over to the sections that interest you most.

### Click around

Let's be honest: who reads the docs? Right? It's totally fine to explore your Kirby installation on your own without our help. If you don't want to miss out on any of the possibilities though, the docs are always here to help.
