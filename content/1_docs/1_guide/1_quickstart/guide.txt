 <info>
When copying files to a remote server via (S)FTP, make sure to copy the `.htaccess` file as well. By default, files starting with a dot are invisible in the filesystem, so make sure enable the display of invisible files before copying.
</info>

## Requirements

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Web server</th>
        <th>PHP</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="text">
            Any of the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Apache 2</li>
                <li>Nginx</li>
                <li>LiteSpeed</li>
                <li>Caddy</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
        <td class="text">
            <ul>
                <li>PHP 7.1+</li>
                <li>mbstring extension</li>
                <li>curl extension</li>
                <li>ctype extension</li>
                <li>gdlib extension</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

The server OS must be POSIX compatible.

<info>
Kirby's (link: docs/guide/api/introduction text: REST API) (used by the Panel) uses `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` HTTP requests. For the Panel to work, make sure that your server settings support them (some hosting providers disable `PATCH` request in particular in their default settings, so if in doubt, contact your provider).
</info>


If you want to use PHP's built-in server (**not recommended**), you have to start it up with Kirby's router:

```php
php -S localhost:8000 kirby/router.php
```

### Browsers for the Panel

Kirby does not modify the output of your site's templates and thus has no effect on its browser requirements. The Panel is built on modern browser features though and has a couple browser requirements which need to be met by your site's editors.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Desktop</th>
        <th>Mobile</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="text">
            <ul>
                <li>Chrome 57+</li>
                <li>Firefox 54+</li>
                <li>Safari 10.1+</li>
                <li>Edge 16+</li>
                <li>Opera 44+</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
        <td class="text">
            <ul>
                <li>Mobile Safari 10.3+</li>
                <li>Android Browser 67+</li>
                <li>Chrome for Android 70+</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Alternative ways to install Kirby

There are alternative installation methods for advanced users who prefer to install and update Kirby using commands on the command line or in their version control tool. Check them out and use whichever method you prefer.

- (link: docs/cookbook/setup/composer text: Installation via Composer)
- (link: docs/cookbook/setup/git text: Installation as Git submodule)

<info>
If you don't have a local development environment yet and don't know what to use, check out our (link: docs/cookbook/setup/development-environment text: Local development environment) recipe.
</info>

### Installation guides for webhosts
Some providers have created dedicated guides how to install Kirby on their servers. If you are with one of these providers, keep on reading:
- (link: https://lab.uberspace.de/guide_kirby.html text: Installation on Uberspace)
- (link: https://help.fortrabbit.com/install-kirby-3 text: Installation on fortrabbit)
- (link: https://www.rosehosting.com/blog/how-to-install-kirby-cms-on-ubuntu-18-04/ text: Installation on RoseHosting)


## Create your first account

Kirby's control panel (aka. the Panel) comes without any pre-installed accounts. Open `http://yourdomain.com/panel` in the browser to start the installer and create the first account.

<info>
For security reasons, you cannot install the Panel on a public server by default. To allow this, you can enable the (link: docs/reference/system/options/panel#allow-the-panel-to-be-installed-on-a-remote-server text: `panel.install` option):
</info>

## Register your installation

Once you publish your website, you need to (link: buy text: purchase a Kirby license). We will send you a unique license code for your domain. You can register your installation with the following steps.

1. Open the Panel at `http://yourdomain.com/panel` and log in.
2. Click on "Register" at the top.
3. Enter your license code and your email address and press "Ok".

### Without using the Panel

<since v="3.3.0">

If you don’t want the Panel to connect to our server, registration via the Panel fails, or you are not using the Panel at all, you can download your license files directly from our licenses website:

1. Visit (link: https://licenses.getkirby.com).
2. Log in with the email you used when you purchased the license and any order number.
3. In the list of your licenses, click on the key you want to register.
4. Use the "Download license file" button to download the license file.
5. Rename the downloaded file to `.license` (without extensions).
6. Place it in the `/site/config/` folder of your Kirby installation.

</since>

## Updates

To update Kirby, download the latest version and replace the `kirby` folder.

That's it! Because Kirby does not use a database by default, you don't have to run any database migrations.

<warning>
Never update a live website directly on the server. Test updates locally first to see if something breaks.
</warning>

### Updating Kirby with the advanced methods

If you used one of the advanced installation methods, you can also use them to update Kirby:
