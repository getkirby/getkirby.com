Title: Working with dates

----


Description: Use dates in your content files and output different date formats.

----
Text:

Any field in Kirby can be converted to a date if the content is parseable by PHP.

```kirbycontent
    Title: Super Nice Content
    ----
    Published: 2018-11-21
    ----
```

In your template …

```php
<?= $page->published()->toDate('d.m.Y') ?>
```

As an argument you can pass any valid (link: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php text: PHP date format string). If you don't pass an argument, the function will return a Unix timestamp, which you can use for more fancy PHP date calculation.

<info>
We suggest that you stick to the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` (i.e. `2018-11-21 11:22:33`). If you want to use another date format in your text files, read more about (link: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php text: parseable date formats in PHP).

## Article example

```php
<article>

  <h1><?= $article->title() ?></h1>
  <?= $article->text()->kirbytext() ?>

  <time datetime="<?= $page->published()->toDate('c') ?>" pubdate="pubdate">
    <?= $page->published()->toDate('d.m.Y H:i') ?>
  </time>

</article>
```

## Custom date handler

PHP's date function is great, but if you work on multi-language sites and you need to translate dates, the `strftime` function is actually more powerful. You can change the date handler in your config.

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
    'date.handler' => 'strftime'
];
```

<info>
If you change the date handler you have to adjust all the date format strings in your templates. Find out more about the (link: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php text: strftime date formatting syntax)

In your template …

```php
<?= $page->published()->toDate('%d.%m.%Y') ?>
```
