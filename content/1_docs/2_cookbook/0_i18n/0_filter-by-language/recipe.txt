Description: Learn how to prevent Kirby's falling back to the default language if no translated content exist.

Text:

In a multi-language setup, Kirby falls back to returning the contents of the default language if it can't find a translated content file.

To prevent this, for example when displaying the pages for a menu or a list of articles, we have to filter the pages. Here's how to do this using Kirby's `translation()` method within a filter callback:

```php
<?php
$translatedPages = page('somepage')->children()->visible()->filter(function($child) {
  return $child->translation(kirby()->language()->code())->exists();
});
```
