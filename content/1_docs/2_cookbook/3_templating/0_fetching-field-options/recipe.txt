Description: Fetching option text labels instead of values from fields

Text:

A typical select field with a set of predefined options looks like this:

```yaml
fields:
  category:
    label: Category
    type: select
    options:
      design: Design
      architecture: Architecture
      photography: Photography
      3d: 3D
      web: Web design
```

Each option has a value that is stored in the content file and a text label that is displayed for the user.

The advantage of this setup is that your text label can change without affecting the stored value and can be translated depending on the user's language.

If you output the field content in your templates, however, you usually don't want to render the stored value directly, but rather some modified value, in many cases the text label you assigned in the blueprint.

## Simple field setup

You could, of course, use a simple field setup like this:


```yaml
fields:
  category:
    label: Category
    type: select
    options:
      - Design
      - Architecture
      - Photography
      - 3D
      - Web design
```

In this case, what is shown to the user and what is stored in the content file will be exactly the same. This works fine as long as you don't want to translate the text label or provide context information.

## Extended field setup

With an extended version of that setup, you can still store the desired output value but display translated text labels:

```yaml
fields:
  category:
    label: Category
    type: select
    options:
      "Design": 
        en: Design
        de: Design
      "Architecture":
        en: Architecture
        de: Architektur
      "Photography": 
        en: Photography
        de: Fotografie
      "3D": 
       en: 3D
       de: 3D
     "Web design":
       en: Web design
       de: Webdesign
```

But all this only makes sense in a single language installation and is not very versatile. Therefore, let's see how we can stick with the first setup above and still get a more useful output than the key.

## A "category map"

A typical solution is to set up a "category map" in your `config.php`:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
<?php
return [
    'category-map' => [
        'design'       => 'Design',
        'architecture' => 'Architecture',
        'photography'  => 'Photography',
        '3d'           => '3D',
        'web'          => 'Web design'
    ]
]
```
You can name this array whatever you like, of course, to reflect what it contains.

In your template, you can fetch the value from this array like this:

```php
<?= option('category-map')[$page->category()->value()] ?? ucfirst($page->category()->html()) ?>
```

If the value doesn't exist in the array, we fall back to an uppercased version of the field value.

## Multi-language `translations` array

In a multi-language installation, you can store your key/value fields in the `translations` array in your language files:

```php "/site/languages/en.php"
<?php

return [
    'code' => 'en',
    'default' => true,
    'direction' => 'ltr',
    'locale' => [
        'en_US'
    ],
    'name' => 'English',
    'translations' => [      
        'design'       => 'Design',
        'architecture' => 'Architecture',
        'photography'  => 'Photography',
        '3d'           => '3D',
        'web'          => 'Web design'
    ],
    'url' => '/'
];
```

And then fetch the value using the `t()` helper:

```php
<?= t($page->category()->value(), ucfirst($page->category()->html())) ?>
```
Again, we use a fallback for values that do not exist in the `translations` array.

## Fetching values from blueprint

You can also read the options' text labels directly from the blueprint.

```php
<?php
$field = $page->blueprint()->field('category');
echo $field['options'][$page->category()->value()] ?? $page->category()->value();
```
We add the fallback value here just in case someone stores a value from outside of the Panel.

You can find more examples how to access information from blueprints in our (link: text: "Using blueprints in the frontend") recipe.

The same principles can be applied to other fields that use options like the `radio` field, the `multiselect` field, the `tags` field or the `checkboxes` field.

To finish this, let's have a look at how to handle multiple options stored as a comma separated list, for example from the `multiselect` field.

Field setup:

```yaml
fields:
  category:
    label: Category
    type: multiselect
    options:
      design: Design
      architecture: Architecture
      photography: Photography
      3d: 3D
      web: Web design
```

```php
<?php
$field = $page->blueprint()->field('category');
$categories = $page->categories()->split(',');
foreach($categories as $category) {
    echo $field['options'][$category] ?? html($category);
}
```
