## Requirements

- A fresh Kirby (link: try text: Starterkit) as our basis
- Familiarity with the Kirby API, templates and controllers is useful

## Intro

When creating a portfolio, blog or image gallery webpage, we often want to show a limited number of projects, articles or images at first load, but give visitors the possibility to load more with a button. In this recipe, we will go through the steps needed to implement such a solution.

We will base this recipe off the photography page in Kirby's Starterkit which lists a number of subpages with an image and a title.

Kirby's (link: docs/cookbook/templating/pagination text: pagination class) will help us break up the projects into digestible chunks and make the logic pretty straightforward.

## HTML Template

The photography page uses the `photography.php` (glossary: template text: template), which looks like this when untouched:

```php "/site/templates/photography.php"
<?php snippet('header') ?>
<?php snippet('intro') ?>

<ul class="grid" style="--gutter: 1.5rem">
  <?php foreach ($page->children()->listed() as $project): ?>
  <li class="column" style="--columns: 3">
    <a href="<?= $project->url() ?>">
      <figure>
        <span class="img" style="--w:4;--h:5">
          <?= ($cover = $project->cover()) ? $cover->crop(400, 500) : null ?>
        </span>
        <figcaption class="img-caption">
          <?= $project->title()->html() ?>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </a>
  </li>
  <?php endforeach ?>
</ul>

<?php snippet('footer') ?>
```

As a first step, let's move the `<li>` element from the template into a separate (glossary: snippet text: snippet) called `project.php`…

```php "/site/snippets/project.php"
  <li class="column" style="--columns: 3">
    <a href="<?= $project->url() ?>">
      <figure>
        <span class="img" style="--w:4;--h:5">
          <?= ($cover = $project->cover()) ? $cover->crop(400, 500) : null ?>
        </span>
        <figcaption class="img-caption">
          <?= $project->title()->html() ?>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </a>
  </li>
```

… and replace this element with the newly created snippet in the template:

```php "/site/templates/photography.php"
<?php snippet('header') ?>
<?php snippet('intro') ?>

<ul class="grid" style="--gutter: 1.5rem">
  <?php foreach ($page->children()->listed() as $project): ?>
    <?php snippet('project', ['project' => 'project']) ?>
  <?php endforeach ?>
</ul>

<?php snippet('footer') ?>
```

We do this so that we can reuse this snippet again later.

Next, we add a load-more button after the project list, and replace `$page->children()->listed()` with `$projects`. We will define this variable in the next step in a (glossary: controller text: controller).

```php "/site/templates/photography.php"
<?php snippet('header') ?>
<?php snippet('intro') ?>

<ul class="grid" style="--gutter: 1.5rem">
  <?php foreach ($projects as $project): ?>
    <?php snippet('project', ['project' => $project]) ?>
  <?php endforeach ?>
</ul>
<button class="load-more">Load more</button>
<?php snippet('footer') ?>
```

## HTML controller

Now, let's put the logic we need into a new controller. Create a new `photography.php` controller in `site/controllers` with the following code:

```php "/site/controllers/photography.php"
<?php

return function ($page) {
  $limit    = 4;
  $projects = $page->children()->listed()->paginate($limit);

  return [
      'limit'      => $limit,
      'projects'   => $projects,  
      'pagination' => $projects->pagination(),  
    ];
};
```

Here we define the `$projects` variable and paginate the pages collection into chunks of 4 as defined in the `$limit` variable. You can change the chunk size as needed, we use 4 here because we only have a limited set of data.

If we visit the page in the browser at this point, we will see four projects and our super fancy load-more button. However, as much as you might click on the button, nothing will happen yet.

## JSON controller

To implement the logic for the load-more functionality, we create the controller for the JSON (glossary: content-representation text: content representation).

This content representation will be available at the url `localhost/photography.json` and is the URL we will use in the JavaScript in the next step.

```php "/site/controllers/photography.json.php"
<?php

return function ($page) {
  
  $limit      = 4;
  $projects   = $page->children()->listed()->paginate($limit);
  $pagination = $projects->pagination();
  $more       = $pagination->hasNextPage();

  return [
      'projects' => $projects,
      'more'     => $more,
      'html'     => '',
      'json'     => [],
    ];
};
```

The `$more` variable is a boolean and checks if the pagination object still has a next page.

Additionally, we initialize the `$html` and `$json` variables, which will be assigned their values in the `photography.json.php` template in the next step.

## JSON template

We are slowly getting there… Our JSON representation controller now needs a corresponding template that returns the JSON encoded data:

```php "/site/templates/photography.json.php"
<?php

foreach($projects as $project) {

  $html .= snippet('project', ['project' => $project], true);

}
$json['html'] = $html;
$json['more'] = $more;

echo json_encode($json);
```

Again we loop through the projects as before in the HTML template and call the same snippet. This time, we store everything in the `$html` variable, which we add to the `$json` array together with the `$more` variable defined in the controller. Finally, we encode the array so that the template returns the data in JSON format.

If all went well and you open `localhost/photography.json` in your browser, you will see the generated JSON data.

## HTML template, part 2

Before we can get to our last missing piece, the JavaScript, we have to modify the `ul` element in the template a little bit. We add the class name `projects` and the `data-page` attribute, so that we can fetch the number of the next pagination page in our JS.

```php "/site/templates/photography.php"
<?php snippet('header') ?>
<?php snippet('intro') ?>

<ul class="grid projects"  data-page="<?= $pagination->nextPage() ?>" style="--gutter: 1.5rem">
  <?php foreach ($projects as $project): ?>
    <?php snippet('project', ['project' => $project]) ?>
  <?php endforeach ?>
</ul>
<button class="load-more">Load more</button>
<?php snippet('footer') ?>
```

## Javascript

Finally, our last step. Add the following script in `assets/js/templates/photography.js`. By adding this script to this location, we make sure that it is only loaded for the `photography.php` template. And because the footer already has the (link: docs/reference/templates/helpers/js#example__autoloading-template-specific-script-files text: `@auto` parameter) to auto-load all template specific JS files, we don't have to require it specifically.

<info>
If you put the script file into another location, make sure to load it in the footer.
</info>

```js "assets/js/templates/photography.js"
const element = document.querySelector('.projects');
const button  = document.querySelector('.load-more');
let page      = parseInt(element.getAttribute('data-page'));

const fetchProjects = async () => {
  let url = `${window.location.href}.json/page:${page}`;
  try {
    const response       = await fetch(url);
    const { html, more } = await response.json();
    button.hidden        = !more;
    element.innerHTML    += html;
    page++;
    console.log(page);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Fetch error: ', error);
  }
}

button.addEventListener('click', fetchProjects);
```

First we define a set of variables that we need for fetching the projects later on:

```js
// the container `ul` to which we will later append the other chunks of projects
const element = document.querySelector('.projects');
// the load-more button
const button  = document.querySelector('.load-more');
// the next page from the data attribute as explained in the last step
const page    = parseInt(element.getAttribute('data-limit'));
```

With

```js
button.addEventListener('click', fetchProjects);
```

we add an event listener to the button which calls the closure (anonymous function) stored in the `fetchProjects` variable.

Inside the closure, we make a (link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API text: fetch ) request to the JSON representation (current URL suffixed with `.json` plus the pagination page), and on success, we add the elements to the DOM and increment the page counter by one.

When there are no more pages to fetch, we hide the button:

```js
button.hidden = !data.more;
```

That was it. If you want to check if a second or third click works as well, publish the draft that is still lurking in the photography page or add some new cool projects of your own.
