Description: Tie pages to a person. Create an author system for your blog posts.

Assigning one or more people to pages like posts or projects is a common use case and Kirby's user system in combination with the users field is a perfect fit for this.

## Creating authors

Authors can be created as (link: docs/guide/users text: Kirby users). A Kirby user can have different roles, and you can store any information in a user profile, including a profile picture.

Before you add new users as authors, think about what information you want to store for these users. We can then set out to create a (link: docs/reference/panel/blueprints/user text: blueprint for our authors).

In this example, let's create an `author.yml` blueprint, which we store in `/site/blueprints/users`. In our user blueprint, let's define some fields:


```yaml "/site/blueprints/users/author.yml"
title: Author
fields:
    bio:
      label: Bio
      type: textarea
    email:
      label: Email
      type: email
    website:
      label: Website
      type: url
    twitter:
        label : Twitter account
        type: text
```


Since the name is a default field, we don't have to define it here. With this blueprint, we now have defined a new user role and can start adding authors with this role.

In the Panel, this setup will now look like this:

This can be extended to a full database of author contact details and more, depending on your use case.

## How to select an author

Now that we have created a blueprint for the user and added some users in the Panel, we need a way to select one or more authors in our posts. Kirby has a users field that comes in handy for this purpose. Let's set it up in our `article.yml` blueprint:

```yaml "/site/blueprints/pages/article.yml"
sidebar:
  meta:
    type: fields
    fields:
      ...
      author:
        type: users
        multiple: false
      ...
```
In this example we have defined a sidebar with some meta data fields and an authors field. The authors field has some default settings and options you can find in the (link: docs/reference/panel/fields/users text: users field docs). Here we have kept it simple and only set the `multiple` option to `false`, because we only want to select a single author.


In the content file `article.txt`, the selected user is stored in `yaml` format

```kirbycontent
  Title: Content in Kirby

  Date: 2017-08-04 00:00

  Text:  Some great text

  ----

  Author:

  - john.doe@example.com

```

## The article template

You can now fetch the author data in the article template. This is just a basic example of how the article template could look:

```php
<?php snippet('header') ?>

<article>

  <h1><?= $page->title()->html() ?></h1>
  <time><?= $page->date()->toDate('d.m.Y') ?></time>
  <?= $page->text()->kirbytext() ?>

  <?php if($author = $page->author()->toUser()): ?>
    <aside class="author">

      <h1><?= $author->name() ?></h1>

      <?php if($avatar = $author->avatar()): ?>
        <figure>
          <img src="<?= $avatar->url() ?>">
        </figure>
      <?php endif ?>

      <?= $author->bio()->kirbytext() ?>

      <h2>On the web:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="<?= $author->website() ?>">Website</a></li>
        <li><a href="<?= $author->twitter() ?>">Twitter</a></li>
      </ul>

    </aside>
  <?php endif ?>
</article>

<?php snippet('footer') ?>
```

This is very extendible and can give your articles a nice personal touch.

## An authors list

You can also build a list of all authors that have created an article and fetch their articles:

Create a new folder `authors` with an `authors.txt` file and an `authors.php` template.

In that template you can fetch all authors from the articles and build a list out of it.

### authors.php template

```php
<?php snippet('header') ?>
<?php
  $articles = $page->children()->listed();
  // fetch all used authors emails from all articles
  $emails = $articles->pluck('author', '-', true);
  // get a list of all authors filtered by the ones with articles
  $authors = $kirby->users()->filterBy('email', 'in', $emails);
?>

<h1>Authors</h1>

<?php foreach($authors as $author): ?>
  <article class="author">
    <h1><?= $author->name() ?></h1>
    <?php if($avatar = $author->avatar()): ?>
      <figure>
        <img src="<?= $avatar->url() ?>">
      </figure>
    <?php endif ?>
    <ul class="articles">
    <?php
      // filter all articles per author
      $articles = $articles->filter(function($child) use($author){
        return in_array($author->email(), $child->author()->yaml());
      });
      foreach($articles as $article): ?>
        <li><a href="<?= $article->url() ?>"><?= $article->title() ?></a></li>
      <?php endforeach ?>
    </ul>

  </article>
<?php endforeach ?>

<?php snippet('footer') ?>
```

Each author will show up on http://yourdomain.com/authors with the user avatar and a list of articles he or she has written. This can be extended with more info about each author or more info about each article.
