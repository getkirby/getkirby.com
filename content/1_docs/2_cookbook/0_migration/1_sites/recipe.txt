Text:

Kirby 3 comes with a wealth of new features and changes under the hood. In this guide we go through the steps necessary to upgrade your existing Kirby 2 site to Kirby 3 step by step.

<info>
If you find anything that is not covered by this guide, please create an issue on (link: https://github.com/getkirby/getkirby.com text: GitHub).
</info>

## Requirements and installation

### Dropped support for PHP < 7.1

Kirby 3 now requires PHP 7.1+. Please check if your server supports this PHP version before upgrading.

### No Kirby CLI support

The Kirby CLI is no longer compatible with Kirby 3. Kirby and extensions can instead be installed (link: docs/guide/installation text: manually), with (link: docs/cookbook/installation/git text: Git) or with (link: docs/cookbook/installation/composer text: Composer).


## Folder and file structure

### Replace `/kirby` folder

Replace the old `/kirby` folder with the new `/kirby`folder.

### Replace `index.php`

The old `index.php` is no longer compatible. Replace it with the new one.

### Replace `.htaccess` file

If you are on an Apache server, replace the old `.htaccess` file with the new one. On other servers, change your server configuration accordingly.

### Delete the `thumbs` folder

Thumbnails and other media files are now located in `/media` and no longer in the `/thumbs` folder. Removing it should be enough. Thumbnails will be recreated in the `media` folder automatically afterwards.

### Underscore as number separator for folders

To fix many of the sorting number issues in Kirby 2, we moved from

```filesystem
1-projects/
```

to

```filesystem
1_projects/
```

To change the sorting numbers of all your content folders, put the following script into your document root next to the index.php and run it with `http://yourdomain.com/upgrade.php`. Delete this file afterwards.

```php "upgrade.php"
<?php

include 'kirby/bootstrap.php';

Kirby\Cms\System::upgradeContent(__DIR__ . '/content');
```


### Delete accounts and avatars

The Kirby 2 accounts and avatars are not compatible with Kirby 3. Please delete your `/site/accounts` and `assets/avatars` folders and install accounts from scratch.

### License

Kirby 3 requires a license file instead of the K2 config setting.

### Custom folder setup

The (link: docs/guide/configuration#custom-folder-setup text: custom folder setup) is no longer done in `site.php` but in your `index.php`.

## Panel

### Remove Panel folder

The Panel folder has been integrated into the Kirby folder to make updates easier. Therefore, the old Panel folder has to be removed.

### Move and adapt page blueprints

(glossary: blueprint text: Page blueprints) are no longer located in `/site/blueprints`, but in `/site/blueprints/pages`. Moving them to the subdirectory should be enough as a first step. The `site.yml` blueprint remains in `/site/blueprints`.

<info>

If you are updating from an early Kirby 2 version and still use `.php` files for your blueprints, change the file extension to `.yml`(or `.yaml`, if you prefer) and remove the PHP code from the top of the files.
</info>

### Remove subpage and file settings from blueprints

The old subpage and file settings are no longer compatible with Kirby 3. Files are now added via files sections, subpages via pages sections, and files get their own blueprints with meta data:

- (link: docs/reference/sections/pages text: Pages sections)
- (link: docs/reference/sections/files text: Files sections)
- (link: docs/guide/content/files text: File meta data)

The fields will work as before but you might want to restructure them to leverage the (link: docs/guide/blueprints/layout text: new layout features) sections, columns and tabs that give you much more control over the look of forms in the Panel.

### Sort numbering of subpages

The `num` blueprint option to set the numbering scheme for pages is no longer set in the parent page blueprint, but in the page blueprint to which the numbering is actually applied. Details: (link: docs/reference/blueprints/page text: General blueprint options)

### Remove blueprint-based subpage builder

The option to auto-create subpages via a blueprint setting no longer exists. You can use a (link: docs/reference/hooks/page-create-after text: `page.create:after` hook) to achieve the same instead. In fact, you can even define a custom blueprint setting that completely recreates this functionality using Kirby's new `$page->blueprint()` method.

In your blueprint:

```yaml
subpage_builder:
  - title: Gallery
    uid: gallery
    template: gallery
    num: 1
  - title: Info
    uid: info
    num: 2
    template: info
```

In your `config.php`:

```php "/site/config.php"
'hooks' => [
  'page.create:after' => function ($page) {
    $builder = $page->blueprint()->subpage_builder();
    if(!empty($builder)) {

      foreach($builder as $build) {
        $missing = a::missing($build, array('title', 'template', 'uid'));
        if(!empty($missing)) continue;
          try {
            $subPage = $page->createChild([
              'content'  => ['title' => $build['title']],
              'slug'     => $build['uid'],
              'template' => $build['template'],
            ]);

          } catch (Exception $error) {
            throw new Exception($error);
          }
          if($subPage) {
            $subPage->publish();
            if(isset($build['num'])) $subPage->sort($build['num']);
          }

         }
    }

  }
]
```

### Rename field readonly option

The option to make a field readonly (`readonly: true`)  has been replaced with the `disabled` property: `disabled: true`. Change your blueprints accordingly.

### Removed invalid field types

The following field types no longer exist and have to be replaced:

- user field => (link: docs/reference/fields/users text: users field)
- page field => (link: docs/reference/fields/pages text: pages field)
- image field => (link: docs/reference/fields/files text: files field)
- checkbox field => (link: docs/reference/fields/toggle text: toggle field)
- datetime field => (link: docs/reference/fields/date text: date field) with `time` option

Also remove or update custom field types, see (link: #plugins-and-extensions text: plugins and extensions)


### Dashbord and widgets

The Kirby 2 Dashboards no longer exists in Kirby 3. With the Dashboard, Panel widgets are gone. Widgets can be replaced with (link: docs/reference/extensions/sections text: custom Panel sections).

## Configuration

### Syntax changes

In addition to the `c::set()` settings, the standard way of adding options is now to use a `return` statement that returns an array of options:

```php
<?php
return [
    'debug'  => true,
    'someOtherSetting' => 'something'
];
```

These options can be called with `$kirby->option('someSetting')`.

### Removed config options

- The `ssl` config option has been removed. This should be handled in your `.htaccess` file or in your server configuration.

- The `thumbs.presets` option has been removed. If you need this functionality, here's a workaround:

```php "/site/config/config.php

'thumbs' => [
  'presets' => [
    'tiny' => [
      'width' => 50,
      'quality' => 50
    ]
  ]
],
```
Then in your templates, snippets etc.:

```php
<?= $image->thumb(option('thumbs.presets.tiny'));
```

### Changed config options

- `panel.session.timeout`/`panel.session.lifetime` are now handled via the (link: docs/reference/options/session text: session options).


## Frontend

### Date method

The special `date()` method has been removed, because it lead to confusions. It must be replace with the `toDate()` field method.

```php
<?= $page->date('Y-m-d') ?>
```
becomes

```php
<?= $page->date()->toDate('Y-m-d') ?>
```
This now works with all date fields, no matter what the date field is called.

### Accessing arguments from the router in controllers

The ways to (link: docs/guide/templates/controllers#arguments-from-the-router text: access arguments from the router) has changed from

```php
<?php

return function ($site, $pages, $page, $args) {

  // $args contains all arguments from the current route

};
```

to

```php
<?php

return function ($kirby) {

  $args = $kirby->route()->arguments();
    // contains all arguments from the current route

};
```

### Page status

While filter methods like `visible()`, `invisible()` and related Pages methods will still work, these are now deprecated. To make your project future-proof, we recommend that you replace them with (link: docs/reference/pages/listed text: `listed`)/(link: docs/reference/pages/unlisted text: `unlisted`)/(link: docs/reference/pages/published text: `published`) and related methods as required.

### KirbyText pre/post filters

(link: docs/reference/hooks/kirbytags-before text: KirbyText pre) and (link: docs/reference/hooks/kirbytags-after text: KirbyText post) filters now have to be registered as hooks.


### Sending email

Email is now sent using PHPMailer. The way to set email presets and to send email has completely changed, check out the (link: docs/guide/emails text: docs)


### Remove route filters

Route filters do no longer exist. Instead you can hook into the route event using (link: docs/guide/routing#before-and-after-hooks text: the `route:before` and `route:after` hooks).



### Authentication for frontend stuff

In Kirby 3, authentication and permissions are now integrated in every method of the Kirby API. You can no longer just call `$page->delete()` for example without an authenticated user. That means the user must either be logged  in or you need another way to authenticate.

To keep it simple to use the internal APIs to do all sorts of things programmatically and especially when you bootstrap Kirby in your own external script, there is now a way to impersonate an existing users or to create a temporary admin, who can do all those awesome things:

#### Impersonating an existing user

```php
<?php

require 'kirby/bootstrap.php'; // this is  only required in external scripts

// impersonating an existing user
$kirby = new Kirby([
    'users' => [
        [
            'email' => 'bastian@getkirby.com',
            'role'  => 'admin'
        ]
    ]
]);

$kirby->impersonate('bastian@getkirby.com');
$kirby->page('some/page')->delete();
````

#### Impersonating the `kirby` super user

```php
<?php

require 'kirby/bootstrap.php'; // this is  only required in external scripts

$kirby = kirby();
$kirby->impersonate('kirby');
$kirby->page('some/page')->delete();
```


### Various method changes

- `$pagination->items()` was removed, use `$pagination->total()` or `$pagination->pages()`
- `tpl::load()` doesn't accept a third argument anymore
- the `excerpt()` helper method has been removed and the parameters for the `$field->excerpt()` method have changed

## Multi-language installation

### Defining languages

(link: docs/guide/languages/introduction text: Languages) are now defined in the `/site/languages` folder, not in your `/site/config.php`file anymore. Users can now add or remove new languages through the Panel, if the (link: docs/reference/options/languages text: `languages` option) is enabled in the config settings.

### Fetching language variables

(link: docs/guide/languages/custom-language-variables text: Language variables) are no longer fetched via `l()/l::get()` but via the `t()` helper.

## Users and permissions

### User roles

User roles can no longer be defined in the config settings, but solely (link: docs/guide/users/roles text: by adding user blueprints).

### Permissions

(link: docs/guide/users/permissions text: User permissions) are now defined in `.yml` files, not `.php` files like in Kirby 2. Also, the available permissions have changed to make them easier to implement. On the other hand that mean that currently some functionality for fine-grained control of user access is not available.

### Accessing the `$user` object

The user object is no longer accessed via the `$site` but via the `$kirby` object. All references to `$site->user()` have to be replaced by `$kirby->user()`.


## Toolkit

The toolkit has been completely rewritten, new methods have been added, others removed. Some classes have been removed from the toolkit and moved into their own packages, see list below:


| Toolkit class  |  Replacement |
|---|---|
| Bitmask | --  |
| Brick  | (link: docs/reference/html text: Kirby\Toolkit\Html)  |
| C | -- |

| Cookie  | (link: docs/reference/cookie text: Kirby\Http\Cookie)  |
| Crypt  | -- |
| Data  | (link: docs/reference/data text: Kirby\Data)  |
| Database  | Kirby\Database  |
| Db  | Kirby\Database\Db   |
| Detect | Kirby\CMS\System |

| Remote  | Kirby\Http\Remote  |
| Response  | Kirby\Http\Response  |
| Router  | Kirby\Http\Router  |
| S  | Kirby\Session  |
| Server  | (link: docs/reference/server text: Kirby\Http\Server)  |
| Sql  | Kirby\Database\Sql  |
| System  | --  |
| Thumb  | Kirby\Image  |
| Timer  | -- |
| Toolkit  | --  |
| Upload  | Kirby\Api  |
| Url  | Kirby\Http\Url  |
| Visitor  | Kirby\Http\Visitor  |
| YAML  | (link: docs/reference/data text: Kirby\Data\Yaml)  |

The Toolkit classes are now in the  `Kirby\Toolkit` namespace.

## Plugins and Extensions

Kirby 2 sites with a lot of plugins will required the most effort. Plugins have to be moved to our new (link: docs/guide/plugins/plugin-basics text: plugin syntax). Many plugins developers have already converted their plugins to Kirby 3. Some plugins might no longer be necessary, because their functionality is covered by native Kirby 3 features. Other plugins might not have been ported yet.

As a first step you have to remove your plugins so that your site doesn't break. This means removing the plugin folders, but also removing custom fields from blueprints and removing functionality that is added through these plugins.

As a next step, replace old plugins with new ones where available and/or port your own plugins with the help of our (link: docs/guide/plugins text: guides).

### KirbyTags

(link: docs/reference/kirbytags text: KirbyTags) are now defined in a plugin file.
