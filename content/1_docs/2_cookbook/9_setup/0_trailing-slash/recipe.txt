Description: How to enforce URLs with or without trailing slashes

Text:

Providing the same content on different URLs is usually considered problematic because of duplicate content and reduced crawl efficiency. It therefore makes sense to enforce either URLs with a trailing slash or without, i.e. have one redirect to the other.

## Enforce trailing slash

The rule to enforce a trailing slash has to be placed after line #36 in the default `.htaccess` provided with Kirby's Starterkit, and you have to exempt the API and the Panel from the rule to prevent breaking the Panel.

``` ".htaccess"
# force trailing slash
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/api
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/panel
RewriteRule ^(.*[^/])$ /$1/ [L,R=301]
```

## Enforce URLs without trailing slash

The extra rules for the Panel are not needed if you want to enforce URLs without a trailing slash, so these two lines will do the job:

``` ".htaccess"
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^(.*)/$ /$1 [L,R=301]
```
