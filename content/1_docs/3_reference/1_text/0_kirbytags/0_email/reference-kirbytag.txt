Text:

Kirby will automatically encode your email addresses, so they won't be that easily parsed and misused by spam bots.

## Examples and options

### Email without link text

```kirbytext
(\email: bastian@getkirby.com)
```

### Email with link text

```kirbytext
(\email: bastian@getkirby.com text: Send me an email)
```

### Email with a `title` attribute

```kirbytext
(\email: bastian@getkirby.com text: Send me an email title: Contact me)
```

### Email with a `rel` attribute

```kirbytext
(\email: bastian@getkirby.com text: Send me an email rel: me)
```

### Email with a custom CSS class

```kirbytext
(\email: bastian@getkirby.com text: Send me an email class: email)
```
