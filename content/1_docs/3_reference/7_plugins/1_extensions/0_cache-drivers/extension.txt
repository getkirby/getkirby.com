Text:

You can create your own custom cache drivers by extending one of the existing drivers or the base `Cache` class.

## Extending an existing cache driver

To modify only parts of an existing driver like the `FileCache`, you can extend that class and selectively overwrite individual methods, e.g. the `flush()` method in this example:

```php "/site/plugins/your-plugin/index.php"
class CustomCache extends Kirby\Cache\FileCache
{
    public function flush(): bool
    {
        // your custom code
        // ...

        return parent::flush();
    }
}
```

You then have to register the new cache type with Kirby's plugin wrapper:

```php

Kirby::plugin('yourname/custom-cache', [
    'cacheTypes' => [
        'custom' => CustomCache::class
    ]
]);
```

## Extending the `Cache` class

Alternatively, you can extend the `Cache` class to implement a new cache driver.

```php "/site/plugins/your-plugin/index.php"
class SuperCache extends Kirby\Cache\Cache
{
    //implement methods here
}
```

As before, you have to register the new cache driver:

```php

Kirby::plugin('yourname/super-cache', [
    'cacheTypes' => [
        'super' => SuperCache::class
    ]
]);
```
