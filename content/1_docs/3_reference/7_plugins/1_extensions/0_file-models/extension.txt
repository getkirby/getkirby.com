Title: File models

----

Since: 3.2.0

Text:

File models are registered with the `fileModels` extension.

File models extend Kirby's default file object. Methods that you define in a fike model are available everywhere in Kirby where you call a file of that type.

```php "/site/plugins/file-models/index.php"
class CoverFile extends File
{
    // ...
}

Kirby::plugin('my/plugin', [
    'fileModels' => [
        'cover' => 'CoverFile'
    ]
]);
```
