Since: 3.2.0

Text:

You can override Kirby's default panel views by replacing the view components.

You can replace the following components:

- k-browser-view
- k-login-view
- k-installation-view
- k-site-view
- k-file-view
- k-page-view
- k-settings-view
- k-users-view
- k-user-view

```js "/site/plugins/my-panel-views/index.js"
panel.plugin("my/view-plugin", {
  components: {
    "k-users-view": {
      // your Vue component code goes here. 
    } 
  }
});
```

The Panel views are often very complex. If you want to replace them without loosing features, check out the orginal source code for each component. You can find them in https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/tree/master/panel/src/components/Views
