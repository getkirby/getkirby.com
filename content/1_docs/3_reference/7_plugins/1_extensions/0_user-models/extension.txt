Title: User models

----

Text:

User models are registered with the `userModels` extension.

User models extend Kirby's default user object per role. Methods that you define in a user model are available everywhere in Kirby where you call a user of the role for which they were defined.

```php "/site/plugins/user-models/index.php"
class EditorUser extends User
{
    public function profile() {
        return page('profiles')->find($this->username());
    }
}

Kirby::plugin('my/plugin', [
    'userModels' => [
        'editor' => 'EditorUser'
    ],
]);
```

In user models you can define your own methods for a user role, or even override standard user methods.
