Text:

Snippets are registered with the `snippets` extension. The extension accepts an array of key/value pairs, where the key is the name of the snippet and the value the path to the file in your plugin folder.

```php
Kirby::plugin('your/plugin', [
	'snippets' => [
		'header' => __DIR__ . '/snippets/header.php'
	]
]);
```
