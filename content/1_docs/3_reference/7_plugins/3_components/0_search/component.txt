Title: Search

Text:

If you are not happy with our built-in search for collections, you can create your own.

<info>
Keep in mind that the search component will be used for all searches of collections (e.g. pages, users, fields) that use the [`->search()`](/docs/reference/@/classes/cms/collection/search) method.

```php "/site/plugins/my-search/index.php"
Kirby::plugin('my/search', [
   'components' => [
      'search' => function (Kirby $kirby, Collection $collection, string $query = null, $params = []) {

            // only search in the field named keywords
            $result = $collection->filterBy('keywords', '*=', $query);

            return $result;
        }
  ]
]);
```
