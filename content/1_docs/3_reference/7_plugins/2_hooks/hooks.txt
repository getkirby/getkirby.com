## Details

Hooks allow you to react on Kirby events like file uploads, page updates etc.

Hooks can execute code, but you can't return anything from them or redirect anywhere. If you try to, an error is thrown in the Panel.

Kirby provides two variants of each hook: `before` and `after` hooks.

## `Before` hooks

A `before` hook is triggered before an action is executed, i.e. before a page is actually updated, a file uploaded, a route called etc.

Typical use cases for `before` hooks include:

- Throw an error to prevent certain users from executing an action in general or under certain circumstances.
- Store information in the session.
- Log something before an action is executed.
- …

## `After` hooks

An `after` hook is triggered right after the action was executed. Some typical use cases for these hooks are:

- Automatically resize a huge image and save a smaller version instead.
- Modify user entered information when a user saves the page.
- Log something when an action is executed.
