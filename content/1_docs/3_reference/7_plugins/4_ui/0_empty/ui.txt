Title: Empty
----
Text:

Whenever you have to deal with an "empty" state, such as an empty list or a search without results, you can use the `k-empty` component to make it a bit nicer. The component combines an icon with text in a wrapper box.

```html
<k-empty icon="image">No images yet</k-empty>
```

## Events

You can bind any events to the component

```html
<k-empty icon="image" @click="addFirst">No images yet</k-empty>
```
