Title: View
----
Text:

The View component is a very basic wrapper, that makes sure to keep the right padding around your interface and also limits the max width. You should use it for full screen layouts only.

```html
<k-view>
  <!-- your interface goes here -->
</k-view>
```

<info>View components should never be nested</info>
