Excerpt: Overrides the defaults for requests to remote servers

----

Since: 3.4.0

Text:

This option defines global default values for all requests that are made with the `Kirby\Toolkit\Remote` class.

## Example

```php
return [
    'remote' => [
        'agent'   => 'My Awesome Site',
        'timeout' => 20
    ]
];
```

## Configuring the list of allowed certificate authorities (CAs) for HTTPS requests

Kirby ships with a CA bundle based on the Mozilla CA list. We keep that CA bundle up-to-date with new Kirby releases.

The CA bundle is used whenever a request to an HTTPS destination is made.

If you want to use a different CA bundle or disable verification completely (not recommended!), you can set the `remote.ca` option:

```php
<?php

return [
    'remote' => [
        'ca' => ...
    ]
];
```

Options are:

- An absolute path to a CA file in `.pem` format
- An absolute path to a CA directory with certificate files that cURL can understand
- The special value `Remote::CA_INTERNAL` for Kirby's internal CA (default)
- The special value `Remote::CA_SYSTEM` to use the CA bundle that is configured in `php.ini`
- `false` to disable TLS verification completely (not recommended!)
