Excerpt: Enables/disables PHP errors

Text:

A quick way to turn on/off PHP errors.

```php
return [
    'debug'  => true
];
```

<warning>
Make sure to disable `debug` mode in production! Displaying PHP errors on a public server can be a serious security risk: 

- Error messages are displayed with detailed information about the code structure (e.g. file path, class, method)
- With Whoops enabled, there will be even more detailed information about the code structure
- Detailed error messages for login failures could leak information to attackers

In a production environment, always log errors to your PHP error logs.
