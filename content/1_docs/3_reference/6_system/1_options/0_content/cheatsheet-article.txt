Excerpt: Set how Kirby handles content

----

Text:

## Content file extension

Set the extension you want to use for your content files.

Possible values: `txt`| `md` (default: `txt`)

```php
return [
  'content' => [
    'extension' => 'md'
  ]
];
```

## Ignore files/folders

Set an array of file/folder names that are not scanned by Kirby's core.

```php
return [
  'content' => [
    'ignore' => []
  ]
];
```

## Content locking

<since v="3.2.5">
Deactivate the content locking mechanism used by the Panel to prevent concurrent edits to a page, file or user:

```php
return [
  'content' => [
    'locking' => false
  ]
];
```
</since>

## Salt for drafts and media files

<since v="3.4.0">
URLs of page drafts and media files contain a hashed token that should be hard to guess. The token is based on the filesystem path of the page/file by default, but you can define your own salt that will be used instead:

```php
return [
  'content' => [
    'salt' => '...'
  ]
];
```

You can also dynamically generate a salt based on the model that needs a token:

```php
return [
  'content' => [
    'salt' => function ($model) {
      return '...';
    }
  ]
];
```
</since>
