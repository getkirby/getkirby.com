Excerpt: Set the name of the home page folder

----

Text:

By default, the name of the home page folder is called `home`. This folder must be present, unless you set the home folder to another folder with this option.

Example to set the ` home` folder to the `blog` folder:

```php
return [
  'home' => 'blog'
];
```
