## Enabling/disabling the cache

```php
return [
  'cache' => [
    'pages' => [
      'active' => true
    ]
  ]
];
```

## Cache driver

Set a different cache driver, default is file driver.

```php
return [
  'cache' => [
    'driver' => 'memcached'
  ]
];
```

The following cache drivers are available:

| Cache Driver | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| FileCache | File System Cache Driver |
| ApcuCache | Driver for Apcu cache |
| MemCached | Driver for Memcached cache server |
| MemoryCache | Driver for caching the current request in memory |
| NullCache | Dummy Cache Driver (does not do any caching) |

You can also set a registered custom cache driver here. Check out the plugin reference (link: docs/reference/plugins/extensions/cache-drivers text: how to create a custom cache driver).

<info>
Make sure the selected cache driver is enabled on/supported by your server.
