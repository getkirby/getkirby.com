## Enabling/disabling the cache

```php
return [
  'cache' => [
    'pages' => [
      'active' => true
    ]
  ]
];
```

## Cache driver

Set a different cache driver, default is file driver.

```php
return [
  'cache' => [
    'driver' => 'memcached'
  ]
];
```

You can also set a registered custom cache driver here. Check out the plugin reference (link: docs/reference/plugins/extensions/cache-drivers text: how to create a custom cache driver).

<info>
Make sure the selected cache driver is enabled on/supported by your server.
