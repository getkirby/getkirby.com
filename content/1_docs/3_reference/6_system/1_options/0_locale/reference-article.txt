You can also define the locale names as strings (for example if you are loading the confguration from a JSON file):

```php
return [
  'locale' => [
    'LC_ALL'      => 'tr_TR.utf-8',
    'LC_COLLATE'  => 'tr_TR.utf-8',
    'LC_MONETARY' => 'tr_TR.utf-8',
    'LC_NUMERIC'  => 'tr_TR.utf-8',
    'LC_TIME'     => 'tr_TR.utf-8',
    'LC_MESSAGES' => 'tr_TR.utf-8',
    'LC_CTYPE'    => 'en_US.utf-8'
  ]
];
```

<info>
The `LC_ALL` locale should always be set as it is used as a default locale internally in the Kirby core. Other locales can be set to override the default `LC_ALL` locale for specific use-cases.
