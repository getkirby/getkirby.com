## Set language for slug generator

<since v="3.0.3">
You can set a language for Kirby's slug generator, so that it uses the language specific settings:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'slugs' => 'de'
];

```

Additionally, you can define custom rules:

```php  "/site/config/config.php"
Str::$language = [
  'ß' => 'sz' 
];
```
