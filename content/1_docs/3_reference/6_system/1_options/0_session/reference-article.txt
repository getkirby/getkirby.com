Excerpt: Configuration settings for Kirby sessions

----

Text:

You can define the following configuration options in your `/site/config/config.php`:

```php
<?php

return [
    'session' => [
        'durationNormal' => 7200,            // default: 2 hours
        'durationLong'   => 1209600,         // default: 2 weeks
        'timeout'        => 1800,            // default: half an hour
        'cookieName'     => 'kirby_session',
        'gcInterval'     => 100              // default: cleanup every ~100 requests
    ]
];
```

## `durationNormal`

Maximum duration of a normal session in seconds; if that time is over and the session has not been renewed, the session becomes invalid and is deleted from the server.

<info>
Renewing happens automatically in the background. You can read more about this (link: docs/guide/sessions#the-session-lifecycle text: in the guide).
</info>

## `durationLong`

If you tick the "keep me logged in" checkbox in the Panel, you get a "long" session, which has a longer duration and no activity timeout, so you can close the browser window and come back at any time within the configured duration.

## `timeout`

The duration options above define the absolute session expiry. Like in Kirby 2, there is also an additional activity timeout: If the session wasn't seen for this time, the session also becomes invalid.

<info>
If you leave a Panel window open, the session never expires, even without clicking on anything.
</info>

## `cookieName`

The name of the session cookie

## `gcInterval`

Expired sessions are automatically cleaned up from the `/site/sessions` directory. To increase performance, this only happens every few requests.

You can also disable this process completely by setting the option to `false` and then (link: docs/guide/sessions#manually-collecting-garbage text: manually calling the garbage collector) from a Cronjob.
