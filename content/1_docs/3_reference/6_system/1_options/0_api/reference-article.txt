Excerpt: Set options for Kirby's REST API

----

Text:

## Disable the API

You can completely disable the API for the frontend.

```php
return [
  'api' => false
];
```

<info>
Please note that the Panel also relies on the API â€“ the Panel won't work if you disable the API.
</info>

## Change the API slug

You can set a custom slug. The default slug is `api`.

```php
return [
  'api' => [
    'slug' => 'rest'
  ]
];
```

All endpoints are now available at `https://yourdomain.com/rest/`.


## Allow insecure requests

By default authentication via (link: docs/guide/api/authentication#http-basic-auth text: basic auth) is only permitted when https is enabled. In rare cases (e.g. during local development), it might be necessary to allow basic auth even when https is not enabled.

```php
return [
  'api' => [
    'allowInsecure' => true
  ]
];
```

<warning>
Please keep in mind that this option makes your Kirby installation less secure.
</warning>

## Custom API elements

Check out the (link: docs/reference/plugins/extensions/api text: API extension reference) to learn more about adding **custom API endpoints, models, collections or more**. Instead of using a plugin, you can add them to your config options in the same manner.

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'api' => [
    'routes' => [
      [
        'pattern' => 'my-endpoint',
        'action'  => function () {
          return [
            'hello' => 'world'
          ];
        }
      ]
    ]
  ]
];
```
