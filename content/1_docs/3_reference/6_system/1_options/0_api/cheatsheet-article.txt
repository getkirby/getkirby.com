Excerpt: Set options for Kirby's REST API

----

Text:

You can completely disable the API for the frontend or set a custom slug. The default slug is `api`.

## Disable the API

```php
return [
  'api' => false
];
```

## Change the API slug

```php
return [
  'api' => [
    'slug' => 'rest'
  ]
];
```

## Allow insecure requests

By default authentication via (link: docs/guide/api/authentication#http-basic-auth text: basic auth) is only permitted when https is enabled. In rare cases (e.g. during local development), it might be necessary to allow basic auth even when https is not enabled.

```php
return [
  'api' => [
    'allowInsecure' => 'true'
  ]
];
```

<warning>
Please keep in mind that this option makes your Kirby installation less secure.
