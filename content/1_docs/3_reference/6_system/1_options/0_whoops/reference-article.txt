Excerpt: Enables/disables the Whoops debugger

----

Text:

The Whoops debugger is a comfortable way to detect issues in your templates and plugins and fix them quickly. It is activated by default when Kirby is in debug mode, but if you prefer you can disable it to fall back to regular PHP error handling.

```php
return [
  'whoops' => false
];
```
