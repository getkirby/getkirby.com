Title: Urls

----

Excerpt:

All main system URLs are available from the `$kirby->urls()` object and can be used to create valid links.

----

Custom:

If you want to overwrite the Url you can do this in your `index.php` by passing a custom Url setup to the Kirby constructor.

```php "/index.php"
<?php

include 'kirby/bootstrap.php';

$kirby = new Kirby([
    'urls' => [
        '{{ url }}' => 'https://example.com/custom/url',
    ],
]);

echo $kirby->render();

```
