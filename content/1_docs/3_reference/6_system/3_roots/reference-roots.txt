Title: Roots

----

Excerpt:

The `$roots` object gives you access to the roots of the different folders that make up your Kirby installation. This is useful whenever you want to access those folders to fetch a file from a folder etc.

----

Custom:

If you want to overwrite the root you can do this in your `index.php` by passing a custom roots setup to the Kirby constructor.

```php "/index.php"
<?php

include 'kirby/bootstrap.php';

$kirby = new Kirby([
    'roots' => [
        '{{ root }}' => '/absolute/path/to/custom/root',
    ],
]);

echo $kirby->render();

```

Text:

## Accessing the `$roots` object

Before you can call the method, you need access to the roots object:

```php
$roots = $kirby->roots();
```

This will return an object with all the roots of the installation.

With the object in place, you can now call the available roots methods.

Instead of the following syntax to access the folders:

```php
$accounts = $kirby->roots()->accounts();
```

you can also use the `root()` method to access an individual root directly:

```php
$accounts = $kirby->root('accounts');
```
