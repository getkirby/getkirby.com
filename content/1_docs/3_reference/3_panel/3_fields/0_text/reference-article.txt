(docs: panel-field-max-and-min field: text)

## How to use in templates/snippets

Simple usage:

```php
<?= $page->text() ?>
```

As with other fields, you can use Kirby's (link: docs/reference/templates/field-methods text: field methods) to manipulate the output. Here are a few examples:

Escape the field value:

```php
<?= $page->text()->escape() ?>
```

Convert to valid HTML:

```php
<?= $page->text()->html() ?>
```

With fallback text if field is empty:

```php
<?= $page->text()->or('Some fallback text') ?>
```
