Text:

The time field is perfect for events or any other kind of time-based field content. It creates a select box with all available times of the date defined by certain interval.

## Example

```yaml
fields:
  time:
    label: Time
    type: time
```

## Blueprint

(field-options: time)

## Notation

You can choose between the 12 hour (AM/PM) and the 24 hour format. The default is the 24 hour format.

```yaml
fields:
  time:
    label: Time
    type: time
    notation: 12
```

## Step

Intervals between selectable options are defined in minutes. The default is `60` minutes.

```yaml
fields:
  time:
    label: Time
    type: time
    step: 30
```

## Default value

The default value can either be set to a specific time (e.g. `17:00`) – and will be matched with the closest interval option – or as `now`.

```yaml
fields:
  time:
    label: Time
    type: time
    default: now
```
