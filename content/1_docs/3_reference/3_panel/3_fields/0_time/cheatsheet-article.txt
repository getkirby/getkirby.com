Text:

The time field is perfect for events or any other kind of time-based field content. It creates a select box with all available times of the date defined by certain interval.

## Example

```yaml
fields:
  time:
    label: Time
    type: time
```

## Field properties

(field-options: time)

## Notation

You can choose between the 12 hour (AM/PM) and the 24 hour format. The default is the 24 hour format.

```yaml
fields:
  time:
    label: Time
    type: time
    notation: 12
```

## Step

Intervals between selectable options are defined in minutes. The default is `60` minutes.

```yaml
fields:
  time:
    label: Time
    type: time
    step: 30
```

## Default value

The default value can either be set to a specific time (e.g. `17:00`) – and will be matched with the closest interval option – or as `now`.

```yaml
fields:
  time:
    label: Time
    type: time
    default: now
```

## How to use in templates/snippets

To output the field value as is:

```php
<?= $page->time() ?>
```

Render time in 24 hour format

```php
<?= $page->time()->toDate('H:i') ?>
```

With timezone identifier:

```php
<?= $page->time()->toDate('H:i e') ?>
```

Render the time in 12 hour format with am/pm:

```php
<?= $page->time()->toDate('g:i a');
```
