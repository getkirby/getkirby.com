## Example

```yaml
fields:
  downloads:
    label: Downloads
    type: files
```

## Field properties

(field-options: files)

## Limit the number of files

### Min and max files
You can set the minimum/maximum number of files that can be selected:

```yaml
fields:
  downloads:
    label: Select files...
    type: files
    min: 1
    max: 3
```

### Multiple or single mode

If you only want to select a single file, set `multiple` mode to `false` (default is `true`).

```yaml
fields:
  downloads:
    label: Select files...
    type: files
    multiple: false
```

## Layout

You can switch between `list` and `card` layout. Default is `list` layout.

```yaml
fields:
  downloads:
    label: Select files...
    type: files
    layout: cards
```

## Querying files

The `query` option let's you limit the set of files to be included. When not set, it defaults to all files of the current page.

### Limit the set to images

```yaml
gallery:
  type: files
  query: page.images
```

You can use all file types available in Kirby here (`images`, `documents`, `videos`, `audio` and `code`).

### Querying files from other pages

You can get as complex as you like, e.g. get all images of all children of the `photography` page that use the `cover` template:

```yaml
gallery:
  type: files
  query: site.find('photography').children.images.filterBy('template', 'cover')
```

You can find more example how you can use the query language in the (link: docs/guide/blueprints/query-language text: guide).

## Upload options

<since v="3.2.0">

By default, the files field allows you to upload files. You can define the `Add`button behavior with the `uploads` option: When clicking on the `Add` button, you can either select a file and/or upload a file (which is then automatically selected).

### Prevent uploading

You can set the `upload` property to false to prevent file uploads:

```yaml
gallery:
  type: files
  uploads: false
```

### Destination and template

By default all files will be uploaded to the current page and without a predefined template. With the additional options you can fetch files from anywhere and upload them to specific pages. You can also control which file template should be assigned by default:

```yaml
gallery:
  type: files
  uploads: 
    parent: site
    templates: files-upload
```

If you want to upload to the current page and only assign a template, you can directly assign it to the `uploads` property:

```yaml
gallery:
  type: files
  uploads: files-upload
```

</since>

## How to use in templates/snippets

### Single file

To convert a single file to a file object, use the [`toFile()`](/docs/reference/templates/field-methods/to-file) method:

```php
<?php if($image = $page->cover()->toFile()): ?>
  <img src="<?= $image->url() ?>" alt="">
<?php endif ?>
```

### Multiple files

To convert multiple files to a files collection, use the [`toFiles()`](/docs/reference/templates/field-methods/to-files) method:

```php
<?php
$images =  $page->gallery()->toFiles();
foreach($images as $image): ?>
  <img src="<?= $image->url() ?>" alt="">
<?php endforeach ?>
```
