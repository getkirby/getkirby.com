Text:

The date field generates a simple input with a nice date picker. It can be setup to display and store dates.

## Example

```yaml
fields:
  published:
    label: Published on
    type: date
```

## Field properties

(field-options: date)

## Time settings

To enable time imput, set the `time` option to `true`:

```yaml
fields:
  published:
    label: Published on
    type: date
    time: true
```

For more control over the time selector, you can set the `step` option. Default is `5`.

```yaml
fields:
  published:
    label: Published on
    type: date
    time: true
      step: 1  # 1 minute steps
```

## How to use in templates/snippets

To convert the value to a date object, use the [`toDate()`](/docs/reference/templates/field-methods/to-date) method.

Without a date format, the `toDate()` field method renders a UNIX timestamp:

```php
<?= $page->published()->toDate() ?>
```

Use a date format to render the date in your desired (link: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php text: output format):


```php
<?= $page->published()->toDate('Y-m-d') ?>
```


If you have set the (link: docs/reference/system/options/date text: date handler) to `strftime` in your config, use the corresponding (link: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php text: format syntax):

```php
<?= $page->published()->toDate('%Y-%m-%d') ?>
```
