Title: Structure

Excerpt:

Structured data input, which stores data in a field as YAML.

Guide: blueprints/fields

Text:

The structure field makes it possible to add multiple complex entries to a field, which will be stored as (glossary: YAML). A typical use case would be a list of addresses, team members or a restaurant menu.

## Example

```yaml
fields:
  addresses:
    label: Addresses
    type: structure
    fields:
      street:
        label: Street
        type: text
      zip:
        label: ZIP
        type: text
      city:
        label: City
        type: text
```

Such a structure will be stored in the content file like this:

```yaml
addresses:
-
  street: Rue de WTF 17
  zip:    1112
  city:   Monaco
-
  street: 1212 Broadway
  zip:    4321
  city:   New York
-
  street: At the beach
  zip:    9999
  city:   The capitol of the Bahamas
```

## Field properties

(field-options: structure)

## Fields

You can define any number of fields and use the same (link: docs/reference/panel/fields text: field types listed):

(reference: panel/fields)

## Default values

You can set default values for structure fields which will prepopulate the field:

```yaml
  emails:
    label: Emails
    type: structure
    default:
      - email: bastian@getkirby.com
      - email: lukas@getkirby.com
      - email: nico@getkirby.com
      - email: sonja@getkirby.com
    fields:
      email:
        label: Email
        type: email
```

## Table columns

You can define the columns that are shown in the table. This is especially useful if you have a lot of fields in your structure and you don't want to show them all on first sight, but still keep them editable. Columns can also change the text alignment, set a custom width and define a before and after text that will be prepended or appended to the value.

| Option | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `width`| `1/2`, `1/3`, `1/4`, `2/3`, `3/4` (any fraction since v3.2.0)| Set width of column
| `align` | `left`, `center`, `right` | Set text alignment
| `before`| `string` | Set text to prepend value
| `after` | `string` | Set text to append value

### Example

```yaml
fields:
	holidays:
		type: structure
		columns:
			title:
				width: 1/4
			images:
				width: 1/2
			price:
				width: 1/4
				align: right
				after: "USD"
		fields:
			title:
				type: text
			images:
				type: files
			description:
				type: textarea
			price:
				type: number
```
<since v="3.2.0">
Structure columns ca be set to any fraction and will be automatically calculated into the right width.

```yaml
fields: 
  mystructure: 
    label: Structure
    type: structure
    columns: 
      title: 
        width: 3/5		
      images: 
        width: 1/5
      price: 
        width: 1/10
    fields: 
      title: 
        label: A
        type: text
      images: 
        label: B
        type: text
      price: 
        label: C
        type: text
```        
</since>

## Preview of fields in the table

The structure field tries to create the best possible preview for the field in its table view. If you are using fields provided by a plugin in the structure field, the preview of these can be customized with a (link: docs/reference/plugins/extensions/field-previews text: field preview extension).

## How to use in templates/snippets

To access a structure field in your templates, you can use the [`yaml()`](../../templates/field-methods/yaml) and [`toStructure()`](../../templates/field-methods/to-structure) methods.
