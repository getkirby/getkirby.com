Text:

The info field is a great way to provide inline help or information for your users. You can put any kind of text in this field and it will be displayed as plain text. For better formatting you can use (glossary: Markdown) and (glossary: KirbyText).

## Example

```yaml
fields:
  info:
    label: Info
    type: info
    text: |
      Dear editor,

      each project should have a **cover.jpg**, which will be displayed in the project overview. You should also make sure to fill in all fields correctly.

      In love,
      Your admin
```

### Using `KirbyText`

<since v="3.3.0">
In addition to markdown, you can use `KirbyText` in your info text, even including images:
</since>

```yaml
info:
  text: Check out the &lpar;link: help text: help pages) for details
```

### Themes

The info field is displayed as a blue info box. You can switch the theme with the `theme` option, to match the importance or meaning of the information.

#### Available themes:

- `info` (default)
- `positive`
- `negative`


```yaml
fields:
  info:
    label: Info
    type: info
    theme: negative
    text: This is a very important page type. Please double-check your content before publishing.
```
