Title: Multiselect

----

Excerpt:

A select field that allows you to select multiple options

Guide: blueprints/fields

Text:

The multiselect field displays any number of options in a dropdown selectbox with a search box that helps narrowing down the options. This is perfect if you have lots of options, from which the user can just choose one or more.

## Example

```yaml
fields:
  categories:
    label: Categories
    type: multiselect
    min: 2
    max: 4
    options:
      design: Design
      architecture: Architecture
      photography: Photography
      3d: 3D
      web: Web
```

## Field properties

(field-options: multiselect)

(docs: panel-field-options field: multiselect)

## Customise search behavior 

<since v="3.4.0">
Multiselect fields with a huge amount of options can get a bit less responsive when all options have to be displayed immediately. For that use case, you can customise the `search` option a bit more. Instead of just activating/deactivating it (`true`/`false`), you can pass suboptions: 


```yaml
search:
  min: 3
  display: 10
```

Now the filtering of options will only begin when at least 3 characters have been typed into the search input. And only up to 10 options will be displayed (you can still reveal all fitlered options via an extra click).

## How to use in templates/snippets

A multiselect field stores all selected values in a comma separated list (`value1, value2, value3`) You can split this list with the [`split()`](/docs/reference/templates/field-methods/split) method in your templates and then work with the result:

```php
<ul>
  <?php foreach ($page->categories()->split() as $category): ?>
  <li><?= $category ?></li>
  <?php endforeach ?>
</ul>
```
