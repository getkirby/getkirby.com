Text:

The multiselect field displays any number of options in a dropdown selectbox with a search box that helps narrowing down the options. This is perfect if you have lots of options, from which the user can just choose one or more.

## How to use in templates/snippets

A multiselect field stores all selected values in a comma separated list (`value1, value2, value3`) You can split this list with the [`split()`](/docs/reference/templates/field-methods/split) method in your templates and then work with the result:

```php
<ul>
  <?php foreach ($page->categories()->split() as $category): ?>
  <li><?= $category ?></li>
  <?php endforeach ?>
</ul>
```
