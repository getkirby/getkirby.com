## Getting started

By default the layout field comes with a single 1-column layout and all the default fieldsets from the Blocks field.

```yaml
fields:
  layout:
    type: layout
```

## Defining your own layouts

Defining available layouts is simple: each layout is list of column widths. i.e. `1/2, 1/2` or `1/4, 3/4` …

```yaml
fields:
  layout:
    type: layout
    layouts:
      - "1/1"
      - "1/2, 1/2"
      - "1/4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/4"
      - "1/3, 2/3"
      - "2/3, 1/3"
      - "1/3, 1/3, 1/3"
```

Those layouts will then show up in the layout selector when an editor creates a new row:

## Fieldsets

The layout field also accepts the `fieldsets` option from the blocks field to control blocks in columns.

The fieldsets setup is exactly the same. You can follow the instructions from the (link: ./blocks/block-selector text: Blocks field).

```yaml
fields:
  layout:
    type: layout
    layouts:
      - "1/1"
      - "1/2, 1/2"
      - "1/4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/4"
      - "1/3, 2/3"
      - "2/3, 1/3"
      - "1/3, 1/3, 1/3"
    fieldsets:
      - heading
      - text
      - image
```

## Layout settings

It's often useful to set additional class names, IDs or even something like background colors and images for layout sections. This can be achieved with layout settings.

Layout settings are defined globally. Each layout will then get a "Settings" button in its dropdown and open a settings drawer with the configured fields.

```yaml
fields:
  layout:
    type: layout
    layouts:
      - "1/1"
      - "1/2, 1/2"
      - "1/4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/4"
      - "1/3, 2/3"
      - "2/3, 1/3"
      - "1/3, 1/3, 1/3"
    fieldsets:
      - heading
      - text
      - image
    settings:
      fields:
        class:
          type: text
          width: 1/2
        id:
          type: text
          width: 1/2
        image:
          label: Background image
          type: files
```
