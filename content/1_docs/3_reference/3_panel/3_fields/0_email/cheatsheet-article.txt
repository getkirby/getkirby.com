## How to encode email field output

Unlike the (link: docs/reference/text/kirbytags/email text: email KirbyTag), the email field does not encode your email addresses, to prevent misuse by spam bots. If you want to make use of Kirby's built-in email obfuscation, you have several options:

### Using `html::email()`:

```php
<?= html::email($page->email()) ?>
```

### Using `str::encode()`:

```php
<a href="mailto:<?= str::encode($page->email()) ?>">
    <?= str::encode($page->email()) ?>
</a>
```

### Using `kirbytag()`:

```php
<?= kirbytag([
      'email'  => $page->email(),
      'text'  => 'Contact us'
    ]);
?>
```
