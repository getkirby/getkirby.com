Text:

The textarea field creates a textarea for longer texts with automatic resizing and optional format buttons.

## Example

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    label: Text
    type: textarea
```

## Blueprint

(field-options: textarea)

## Sizes

In some section layouts, a small textarea looks lost. The `size` option sets an initial default height for empty textareas before auto-sizing kicks in. Available sizes:

- `small`
- `medium`
- `large`
- `huge`

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    label: Text
    type: textarea
    size: large
```

## Toolbar

### Disabling the toolbar

If the formatting toolbar should not be available, you can switch it off entirely:

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    label: Text
    type: textarea
    buttons: false
```

### Customizing the toolbar

You can also specify which buttons to show in the toolbar.

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    label: Text
    type: textarea
    buttons:
      - link
      - email
```

## File upload and select

<since v="3.1.0">

You can configure the file upload and select button via the `files` and `uploads` options:

```yaml
textarea:
  type: textarea
  files: page.images
  uploads: textarea-upload
```

The upload template is optional, but is useful if you want to add additional upload validations and check for a type of file or dimensions.

With this, files from the current page are displayed for selection and uploads are saved to the current page. With specifying a `query` in the `files` option and a `parent` in the `uploads` option, you can pull files from other places as well as save them to another page, e.g. a central media storage page:

```yaml
textarea:
  type: textarea
  files:
    query: site.find("media").files.template("textarea-upload")
    image:
      cover: true
  uploads:
    parent: site.find("media")
    template: textarea-upload
```

You can also deactivate file uploads:

```yaml
textarea:
  type: textarea
  uploads: false
```
