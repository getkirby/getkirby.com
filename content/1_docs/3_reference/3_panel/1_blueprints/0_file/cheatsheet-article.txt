Text:

In each (link: docs/reference/panel/blueprints/file text: files section) you can use the `template` option to determine which template will be used for each file within that section. For example, you can create a files section to which users can only upload images and which have a given set of fields, and another section for PDF files with another set of fields.

## Blueprint location

```filesystem
/site/blueprints/files/
```

## Default file blueprint

To create the same set of fields for all file types, you can setup a `default.yml` that is used whenever no custom file template is configured.

```filesystem
/site/blueprints/files/default.yml
```

## Title

The title is required. It will appear in the file view to indicate the selected template for the current file.

```yaml
title: Project Image
```

### Translated titles

The title can be translated by passing an array of translations with the matching language code as key:

```yaml
title:
	en: Project Image
	de: Projekt Bild
```

##  Accept

The `accept` option defines a set of rules which should be validated whenever a file with this type is created. This is perfect to allow only certain mime types, or check for the file size and the image dimensions.

The `accept` option can either be a simple string for a list of accepted mime types, or an array of multiple accept validation rules:

### Simple

```yaml
accept: image/jpeg, image/png
```

### Extended

```yaml
accept:
	mime: image/*
	maxheight: 200
	orientation: landscape
```

| Option | Value |
|----    | ---- |
| `mime` | e.g. `image/jpeg` |
| `maxheight` | `integer` |
| `maxsize` | `integer` |
| `maxwidth` | `integer` |
| `minheight` | `integer` |
| `minsize` | `integer` |
| `minwidth` | `integer` |
| `orientation` | `landscape`/`square`/`portrait`|


## Options

With options, you can control all the file actions that should or should not be available for this particular file type. The option dropdown for files will adjust accordingly.

| Option | Value |
|----    | ---- |
| `changeName` | `true`/`false`  |
| `delete` | `true`/`false` |
| `replace` | `true`/`false`  |
| `update` | `true`/`false`  |
