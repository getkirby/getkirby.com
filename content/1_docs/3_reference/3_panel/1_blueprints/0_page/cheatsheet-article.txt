Title: Page blueprint

----

Excerpt: Page blueprints are located in `/site/blueprints/pages` and control the Panel setup and form fields for pages.

Text:

## Blueprint location

```filesystem
/site/blueprints/pages/
```

## Default page blueprint

To create the same set of fields for all pages, you can setup a `default.yml` that is used whenever no custom page blueprint is configured.

```filesystem
/site/blueprints/pages/default.yml
```

## Title

The title is required and will appear in the list of selectable templates when a new page is created and multiple templates are available.

```yaml
title: Article
```

### Translated titles

The title can be translated by passing an array of translations with the matching language code as key:

```yaml
title:
	en: Article
	de: Artikel
```

## Presets

Presets are typical standard setups for page, pages and files, see (link: docs/guide/blueprints/presets text: presets).

```yaml
preset: page
```

## Sorting

The `num` option defines which numbering scheme to use when a page is published.

<info>
Default sorting is numbering (1 to x) and doesn't need any setup.
</info>

### Alphabetical sorting by page uid

```yaml
num: zero
```

### Sorting by a custom sort number field

```yaml
num: '{{ page.customSortNumberField }}'
```

The return value of the query has to be an integer which will be used for sorting. Learn more about Kirby's (link: docs/guide/blueprints/query-language text: query language).

### Chronological sorting by date field

#### By date
```yaml
num: '{{ page.created.toDate("Ymd") }}'
```

#### By datetime
```yaml
num: '{{ page.created.toDate("YmdHi") }}'
```

<info>
If you use a sorting scheme other than default sorting by number, i.e. automatic sorting, manual sorting in the Panel will be disabled.
</info>
## Statuses

With the `status` option, you define the page status you want to allow for the page. You can also change their label and description. This option gives you a lot of flexibility how you want to use page status in your website.

### Simple example

```yaml
status:
	draft: Draft
	listed: Published
```

### Extended example

```yaml
status:
  draft:
    label: Draft
    text: The article is still in draft mode. It can only be seen by editors with Panel access.
  unlisted:
    label: In Review
    text: The article is online and can be visited with the direct URL. The team must still give the final go to publish it.
  listed:
    label: Published
    text: The article is online and listed in the blog
```

## Icon

The icon can either be one of our (link: docs/reference/panel/icons text: own icons) or an emoji. Icons appear in page lists when no preview image is available.

```yaml
icon: page
```

### Emoji

```yaml
icon: 📚
```

## Options

With options, you can control all the page actions that should or should not be available for this particular page type. The option dropdown for pages will adjust accordingly.


| Option | Value |
|----    | ---- |
| `changeSlug` | `true`/`false` |
| `changeStatus` | `true`/`false` |
| `changeTemplate` | `false` or list of allowed template |
| `changeTitle` | `true`/`false` |
| `delete` | `true`/`false` |
| `preview` | `true`/`false`/template string (see below) |
| `read` | `true`/`false` |
| `update` | `true`/`false` |

(docs: permissions/option-permissions)

## Preview

You can change the link of the preview button or disable it entirely with the option setting.

### Disabling the preview button

For some pages it makes sense to disable the preview entirely.

```yaml
options:
  preview: false
```

### Custom link

The `preview` option can also take any absolute link or a template string.

#### Absolute URL

```yaml
options:
  preview: https://preview.mysite.com
```

#### Template string

You can use Kirby's powerful (link: docs/guide/blueprints/query-language text: query syntax) to create any link dynamically.

```yaml
options:
  preview: "{{ page.parent.url }}/#{{ page.slug }}"
```

## Switching templates

You must define a list of compatible templates with the `changeTemplate` option to allow editors to switch between page templates.

```
options:
  changeTemplate:
    - video-post
    - link-post
    - text-post
```

<info>When an editor switches templates, all fields with the same name and type will be synced. Incompatible fields will be discarded. Be aware of this step when you define the list of compatible templates.</info>

## Examples

You can find examples of different types of page blueprints in the (link: docs/reference/panel/samples text: samples section).
