Title: Info section

----

Excerpt:

Add help text and info boxes to the Panel to help your editors

----

Text:

The info section is perfect for any kind of static text that you want to place in a (glossary: Panel) layout. It can be used for general info, help, warnings and other guides for your editors.

## Example

```yaml
title: Gallery

sections:
  info:
    type: info
    headline: Info
    text: |
      Please double-check the licenses and sources
      of all images before you upload them to the gallery.
```

## Info section vs. info field

The info section behaves pretty much like the (link: docs/reference/panel/fields/info text: info field). Why do we have both of them? Because both are useful. The info field can be placed in a field grid and is perfect to offer help within a form. The info section can be placed anywhere else, especially in layouts that don't need form fields.

## Section properties

(section-options: info)

## Headline

The headline will be displayed above the info section. You can pass a simple headline as a string or you can provide translations for multiple languages, if you have an international editing team.

### Single language

```yaml
headline: This is some very important information
```

### Multiple languages
```yaml
headline:
  en: Attention
  de: Achtung
  es: Attencion
```

### Placeholders

You can inject information from the current page into the headline with template placeholders using our (link: docs/guide/blueprints/query-language text: query language).

```yaml
headline: "{{ page.title }} Information"
```

## Text

The text can be a simple string, Markdown, KirbyText or HTML. Just like the headline, the text can also be translated.

### Single language
```yaml
text: Info
```

### Multiple languages
```yaml
text:
  en: This is some very important information
  de: Das ist eine wichtige Mitteilung
```

### Multi-line text

If you want to write multi-line text with paragraphs, you have to use a special YAML syntax for it.

```yaml
text: |
  Dear Edith,

  this is some multi line text with paragraphs.

  Cheers,
  A. Dmin
```

## Themes
