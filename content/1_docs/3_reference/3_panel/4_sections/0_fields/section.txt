Title: Fields section

Excerpt:

Define forms for your content

Text:

With the fields section you can create flexible forms for your pages. Add all fields in a single fields section or combine multiple sections to achieve more intuitive (glossary: Panel) layouts.

## Example

```yaml "/site/blueprints/pages/article.yml"
title: Article

sections:
  content:
    type: fields
    fields:
      headline:
        label: Headline
        type: text
      intro:
        label: Intro
        type: textarea
      text:
        label: Text
        type: textarea
```

## Section shortcuts

For simple sections that are only used once per blueprint, you can use shortcuts. In its most basic form, a `fields` section consists of the section type as name, and a set of fields:

```yaml
sections:

  fields:
    fields:
      tags: true
      textarea: true
```
This will add a `fields` section the given fields.

Keep in mind that the same section name can only be used once per blueprint.

## Section properties

The fields section has only one option called `fields`. The `fields` option contains a list of field definitions (see example above). Check out the docs for each field type linked below to see what you can do with each field.

## Available field types

## Multiple fields sections

Especially for more complex pages with lots of different field types, it often makes sense to layout fields in multiple columns. That way you can create a main area for the most important content and a sidebar for secondary information for example.

We can use the `columns` option in our blueprint to create such a layout. The number of columns is up to the actual requirements for your page type. You can get started with two columns and a classic sidebar layout, but of course it can get a lot more sophisticated than that. If you aren't yet familiar with using columns to layout your sections, check out (link: docs/guide/blueprints/layout text: the guide).

```yaml
title: Article

columns:

  # main content
  main:
    width: 2/3
    sections:
      content:
        type: fields
        fields:
          headline:
            label: Headline
            type: text
          intro:
            label: Intro
            type: textarea
            size: small
          text:
            label: Text
            type: textarea
            size: large

  # meta information
  sidebar:
    width: 1/3
    sections:
      meta:
        type: fields
        fields:
          date:
            label: Date
            type: date
          author:
            label: Author
            type: users
            multiple: false
          tags:
            label: Tags
            type: tags
```

### Tabs

When the field setup gets too complex, you can also spread forms over multiple tabs. This helps to structure your content even further and simplify the editing tasks for your editors. For example SEO information might be stored in an extra tab, because it's not updated very often, once the page is created.

Here's an example how to move the meta information for the article above into another tab.

#### Content Tab

#### Info Tab

#### Blueprint

```yaml
title: Article

tabs:

  # main content
  content:
    label: Content
    sections:
      content:
        type: fields
        fields:
          headline:
            label: Headline
            type: text
          intro:
            label: Intro
            type: textarea
            size: small
          text:
            label: Text
            type: textarea
            size: large

  # meta information
  meta:
    label: Additional information
    sections:
      meta:
        type: fields
        fields:
          date:
            label: Date
            type: date
          author:
            label: Author
            type: users
            multiple: false
          tags:
            label: Tags
            type: tags
```

## Shortcuts

Fields are such an important feature for pretty much any page type that we've created a number of shortcuts to add fields to blueprints faster.

### A page with just fields

If you need nothing more than fields for a page setup, you can use the `fields` option at the top-level of your YAML file to add all your fields without creating any sections.

```yaml
title: Article

fields:
  headline:
    label: Headline
    type: text
  intro:
    label: Intro
    type: textarea
    size: small
  text:
    label: Text
    type: textarea
    size: large
```

### Fields in columns

If you want to layout different sections you can still use the `fields` shortcut in a column to create a fields section in there.

```yaml
title: Article

columns:

  # main content
  main:
    width: 2/3
    fields:
      headline:
        label: Headline
        type: text
      intro:
        label: Intro
        type: textarea
        size: small
      text:
        label: Text
        type: textarea
        size: large

  # meta information
  sidebar:
    width: 1/3
    fields:
      date:
        label: Date
        type: date
      author:
        label: Author
        type: users
        multiple: false
      tags:
        label: Tags
        type: tags
```

### Fields in tabs

You can also create tabs with just fields and without the need to create any sections.


```yaml
title: Article

tabs:

  # main content tab
  content:
    label: Content
    fields:
      headline:
        label: Headline
        type: text
      intro:
        label: Intro
        type: textarea
        size: small
      text:
        label: Text
        type: textarea
        size: large

  # meta tab
  meta:
    label: Additional Information
    fields:
      date:
        label: Date
        type: date
      author:
        label: Author
        type: users
        multiple: false
      tags:
        label: Tags
        type: tags
```
