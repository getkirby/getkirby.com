## Example

```yaml
title: Blog

sections:

  drafts:
    headline: Drafts
    type: pages
    status: draft
    templates: article

  published:
    headline: Published Articles
    type: pages
    status: listed
    templates: article
```

The pages section has multiple options to control what kind of pages should be displayed, how they should be displayed and what happens if a new page is added.

## Section properties

(section-options: pages)

## Headline

The headline will be displayed above the pages section. You can pass a simple headline as a string or you can provide translations for multiple languages, if you have an international editing team.

### Single language

```yaml
headline: Articles
```

### Multiple languages
```yaml
headline:
  en: Articles
  de: Artikel
  es: Art√≠culos
```

### Placeholders

You can inject information from the current page into the headline with template placeholders using our (link: docs/guide/blueprints/query-language text: query language).

```yaml
headline: "Articles for {{ page.title }}"
```

## Layout

The pages can either be displayed as a simple list or as cards with preview images. The list view is the default view.

### List layout (default)

The `list` layout is perfect for more text-heavy pages, like articles, link lists, simple pages, etc.

```yaml
layout: list
```

(screenshot: list.png)

### Cards layout

The `card` layout is great for media-heavy pages, like galleries, products, projects, etc.

```yaml
layout: cards
```

(screenshot: cards.png)

## Page information

You can fine-tune the display text and additional information for every page in the list with the `text` and `info` options.

### `text`

By default the page title is shown in the list for every page. You can use our template syntax with (link: docs/guide/blueprints/query-language text: query language) to fetch any information from the page and display that instead of the title.

```yaml
text: " {{ page.title.upper }}"
```

### `info`

If you want to display additional information for each page, like a date, year, category or any other field value, you can use the template syntax with (link: docs/guide/blueprints/query-language text: query language) in the `info` option.

```yaml
info: " {{ page.date.toDate('Y-m-d') }}"
```

## Preview images

The (preview) image for each item in the list is configured with the `image` option:

```yaml
image: page.image.findBy("name", "cover")
```

The default preview image is the first image in the folder.

If you need more fine-grained control you can setup the image for each page with further options.

### Show icon instead of image

To display the icon set in the page blueprint or a default icon instead of a preview image, you can set the `image`option to `false`:

```yaml
image: false
```


### `query`

An image query, default `page.image`

```yaml
image:
  query: page.children.first.image
```

### `cover`

Whether or not the image will cover the available space.
Options: `true`, `false (default)`

```yaml
image:
  cover: true
```

#### Examples

| `cover: true` | `cover: false` |
| -   | -   |
| (screenshot: cover.png) | (screenshot: no-cover.png) |

### `ratio`

A freely selectable image ratio

```yaml
image:
  ratio: 16/9
```

#### Examples

| `ratio: 2/3` | `ratio: 1/1` | `ratio: 3/2` | ratio: `16/9` |
| -   | -   | -   | -    |
| (screenshot: 2by3.png) | (screenshot: 1by1.png) | (screenshot: 3by2.png) | (screenshot: 16by9.png) |

<info>
You are not limited to the example ratios above. In fact, Kirby calculates the ratio for you as long as you enter it in the format **`a/b`**
</info>

### `back`

Set an image background.
Options: `pattern (default)`, `black`, `white`
```yaml

image:
  query: page.image.findBy("name", "cover")
  cover: true
  ratio: 1/1
  back: black
```

#### Examples

| `back: pattern` | `back: black` | `back: white` |
| -   | -   | -   |
| (screenshot: pattern.png) | (screenshot: black.png) | (screenshot: white.png) |

## Empty state

With the `empty` option you can define the message which is displayed when no pages are listed in the section.

```yaml
empty: No articles yet
```

## Filtering pages

### Parent

By default, the current page is being used as the parent to find children for the list. With this option, any page on your site can be the parent of the section

```yaml
parent: site.find("blog")
```

### Status

You can filter the list of pages by their status. The available status values are

| Status        | Description |
| -             | -           |
| `draft`         | Only drafts will be shown |
| `listed`        | Only listed pages (with a sorting number) will be shown |
| `unlisted`      | Only unlisted pages (without a sorting number) will be shown |
| `published`     | Listed and unlisted pages will be shown |
| `all (default)` | Drafts, listed and unlisted pages will be shown |

```yaml
status: draft
```

Note that an "Add" button for new pages will only be available if you use either `status: draft` or `status: all`.

### Templates

You can define a list of templates that will be available when adding new pages to the section. It  will also be used to filter pages to be contained in the list.

#### Single template
```yaml
template: article
```

#### Multiple templates
```yaml
templates:
  - project
  - article
```

## "Add" button

Editors can add new pages to the section with the "Add" button in the top right corner.

| `status: all` | `status: draft` | `status: listed` | `status: unlisted` |
| -             | -               | -                | -                  |
| + Add         | + Add           |                  |                    |

<info>The add button will only show up if the status option is set to `draft` or `all`</info>

### Why?

New pages are always added as draft. If the "Add" button showed up in sections that only show listed or unlisted pages, the "Add" button would lead to a confusing interaction for editors, as the new page would not show up in the section.

## Sorting

### `sortBy`

You can sort the list of pages by a given field in descending or ascending order.

```yaml
sortBy: date desc
```

<info>
The `sortBy` option will automatically switch off manual sorting.
</info>

### `sortable`

You can switch off manual sorting entirely with the `sortable` option.

```yaml
sortable: false
```

## Limits

### `limit`

The limit property sets how many pages will be shown per page. If there are more entries in the section, the pagination navigation will be shown at the bottom of the section.

```yaml
limit: 20
```

### `max`

You can define a maximum number of pages, that will be allowed in this section. After the maximum is reached, the add button will be hidden and no more pages can be added.

```yaml
max: 10
```

### `min`

You can also define the minimum number of pages, that need to be added in order to make the page valid.

```yaml
min: 2
```
