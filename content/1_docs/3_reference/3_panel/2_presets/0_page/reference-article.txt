## Basic setup

This allows you to create a very basic blueprint like this:

```yaml
title: Page preset example
preset: page
```

This simple blueprint creates an empty main section and a sidebar with a files and a pages section.

(screenshot: page-empty.png)

You can now extend this basic preset by adding as many fields as you like:

```yaml
title: Default
preset: page

fields:
  intro:
    type: textarea
    size: small
  text:
    type: textarea
    size: small
```

### Empty
(screenshot: page-setup.png)

### Filled
(screenshot: page-filled.png)

And you can of course extend this basic setup in many ways.

## No files or pages section

If you don't want a files or pages section, set either option to false in the page options:

No pages section:

```yaml
pages: false
```

No files section:

```yaml
files: false
```

## Extend files/pages sections

You can extend the pages and files sections with the options available for (link: docs/reference/panel/sections/pages#section-properties text: pages sections) and (link: docs/reference/panel/sections/files#section-properties text: files sections).

### Pages section

```yaml
pages:
  template: default
  max: 10
  min: 1
```

### Files section

```yaml
files:
  template: image
  min: 4
  max: 8
```

## Overwrite the sidebar

You can also overwrite the sidebar column:

```yaml
#  Only an image section
sidebar:
  images:
    extends: sections/images
```
<info>
In this example, we extend an existing files section which we have defined in `/site/blueprints/sections/images.yml`. Instead of extending a existing files section, you can also define a complete (link: docs/guide/blueprints/layout text: files section) here.
</info>


```yaml
# Image section and additional fields
sidebar:
  meta:
    type: fields
    fields:
      date:
        type: date
        time: true
        default: now
      author:
        type: users
      tags:
        type: tags
        options: query
        query:
          fetch: site.tags.toStructure.sortBy("name", "asc")
          text: "{{ structureItem.name }}"
          value: "{{ structureItem.value }}"
  images:
    extends: sections/images
```

<info>
The main column can only take fields, the sidebar can have multiple sections of different types. Completely custom layouts are possible with layout blueprints.
