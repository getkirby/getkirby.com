## Example

You can store structured data in fields with YAML. YAML is a simple structuring syntax.

For this example we are going to store multiple addresses in a single field:

```kirbycontent
    Title: Addresses
    ----
    Addresses:

    -
      Street: Rue de WTF 17
      ZIP:    1112
      City:   Monaco
      Phone:  555-1234
      Email:  me@monaco.org
    -
      Street: 1212 Broadway
      ZIP:    4321
      City:   New York
      Phone:  666-4321
      Email:  me@ny.org
    -
      Street: At the beach
      ZIP:    9999
      City:   The capitol of the Bahamas
      Phone:  777-9999
      Email:  me@bahamas.org
```

These addresses can be fetched and parsed in your templates with the `yaml()` method.

```php
<?php foreach ($page->addresses()->yaml() as $address): ?>
<div>
  <div class="address">
    <?= $address['street'] ?><br />
    <?= $address['zip'] ?> <?= $address['city'] ?>
  </div>
  <div class="contact">
    <?= $address['phone'] ?><br />
    <?= $address['email'] ?>
  </div>
</div>
<?php endforeach ?>

```
