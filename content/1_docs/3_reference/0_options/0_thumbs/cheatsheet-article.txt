Excerpt: Set default configuration for thumbs

----

Text:

## Thumbs driver

Kirby comes with drivers for GD Lib (`gd`) and ImageMagick (`im`), which can be used out of the box. The default thumbs driver is `gd`.

You can also define your own custom thumbs drivers.

```php
return [
  'thumbs' => [
    'driver' => 'im'
  ]
];
```

## Auto Orient

Automatically rotate images based on their exif orientation data.

```php
return [
  'thumbs' => [
    'autoOrient' => true
  ]
];
```

## Quality

The default JPEG compression quality for all thumbnails

```php
return [
  'thumbs' => [
    'quality' => 80'
  ]
];
```

## Additional options for the ImageMagick driver

### `bin`

If the ImageMagick convert binary is not correctly linked, you can set the absolute path to the binary here.

```php
return [
  'thumbs' => [
    'bin' => 'convert'
  ]
];
```

### `interlace`

JPEGs can be set to interlace mode with this option

```php
return [
  'thumbs' => [
    'interlace' => false
  ]
];
```
