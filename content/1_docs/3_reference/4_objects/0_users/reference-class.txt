## How to get a `$users` object

The users object is available via the `$kirby` object:

```php
$users = $kirby->users();
```

This will return a collection of all users of the site.

## Examples

With the `$users` object in place, you can now use all the methods of the class, for example:

### Get all admin users

```php
$admins = $users->filterBy('isAdmin');
```

### Fetch all values of a user field into an array

```php
$userEmails = $users->pluck('email');
```
This will return an array with all the email adresses of all users.

### Sort users

```php
$sorted = $users->sortBy('role');
```
