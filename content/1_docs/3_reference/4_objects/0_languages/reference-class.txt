## Details

To use the methods of the `$languages` class, you need a `$languages` object, which you get can like this:

```php
$languages = $kirby->languages();
```

With the object in place, you can now use it like this:

## Examples

### Find a language by code

```php
$language = $languages->find('de');
```


### Get the number of languages

```php
$numberOfLanguage = $languages->count();
```

### Sort languages by name

```php
$sortedLanguages = $languages->sortBy('name', 'desc');

Excerpt:

The `$languages` object gives you a collection of all the languages that have been defined for your Kirby installation. The methods of this class allow you to filter, find, group, search the languages collection.
