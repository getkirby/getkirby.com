```php
// goes through any subpage, subsubpage, etc. below $page and returns them by template
$articles = $site->index()->filterBy('template', 'article');

// the index method is also perfect for a site-wide search
$results = $site->index()->search('mysearchword');
```

## Details

<warning>
`$site->index()` reads the entire folder structure including all files. Especially on large sites with many files, using `$site->index()` can result in big performance issues, so use with caution.
