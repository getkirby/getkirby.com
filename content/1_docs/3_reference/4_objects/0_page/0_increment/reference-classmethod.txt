Auth: pages.update

## Example

(docs: immutable-objects)

```php
<?php $page->increment('likes') ?>
```

## Notice

The increment method will only work reliably with field values that PHP can parse into a valid integer. Otherwise the field value will be evaluated as zero and incremented to 1 or whatever $by value you pass.
