Title: Pages

Excerpt: The Pages preset is intended for container pages like a blog with subpages in different states of their publishing cycle

Text:

A basic blueprint using a pages preset looks like this:

```yaml
Title: Pages Preset Example
preset: pages
```

By default, this adds two sections of type `pages` to your form: A drafts section and a section of listed/published pages.

This preset is again extendable. For example, if you want to add a section for pages in review while at the same time using predefined sections with additional options, you can do it like this using the keywords `drafts`, `unlisted`, and `listed`:

```yaml
title: Blog
preset: pages
icon: 📜
options:
  url: false
  status: false
  delete: false
drafts:
  extends: sections/articles
  headline: Unpublished articles
unlisted:
  extends: sections/articles
  headline: Articles in review
listed:
  extends: sections/articles
  headline: Published articles
```
