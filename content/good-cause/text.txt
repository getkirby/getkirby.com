## Free licenses
### Students & educators

Students and academic staff members can receive a free Kirby license, upon verification of their school/college/university domain email address or student ID card. The license must *not* be used for other than personal and/or teaching projects.

This also applies to universities, colleges or schools who want to use Kirby in the classroom or for student-related educational projects.

For classroom use (in a course or workshop), we are happy to provide a free license for each student. Please send us a list of student email addresses so we can create the licenses in bulk (please ensure consent of your students) or ask the students to get in contact directly.

### Plugin and theme sites

We provide free licenses for sites showcasing a Kirby extension (plugin or theme).

## Discounted licenses

### Universities & educational organizations

Universities and accredited educational institutions are eligible for a 50% discount when using Kirby for internal projects and applications. If the institution/organization qualifies for Kirby Basic, we also do offer discounts for selected public sites.

Research projects are eligible only if they lack sufficient funding and operate under Open Access rules (or equivalent). Please let us know about the project and your funding situation.
