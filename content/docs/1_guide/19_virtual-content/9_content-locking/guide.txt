By default, the (glossary: Panel) will try to lock a page if a user makes unsaved changes to it to prevent another user to make changes at the same time.

Kirby creates a `.lock` file in the directory of the content file, retrieved via [`Page::contentFileDirectory()`](/docs/reference/objects/page/content-file-directory). However, your virtual page might not support any content file directory. Let's see how to deal with these cases.

## Disable content locking

In many cases of virtual pages, content locking might not be desired. If you want to disable content locking for your virtual page, add a `lock()` method to your (link: docs/guide/templates/page-models text: page model) which returns `null`:

```php "/site/models/reviews.php"
<?php

class ReviewsPage extends Page
{
    public function lock()
    {
        return;
    }
}
```

## Support content locking

To support content locking for your virtual page, Kirby expects a `lock()` method in your (link: docs/guide/templates/page-models text: page model). The method needs to return an object of a custom class that handles the various content locking features:

```php "/site/models/reviews.php"
<?php

class ReviewsPage extends Page
{
    public function lock()
    {
        return new CustomContentLock($this);
    }
}
```

Check out the default `Kirby\Cms\ContentLock` class (link: docs/reference/objects/cms/content-lock text: documentation) as well as (link: https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/blob/main/src/Cms/ContentLock.php text: source code) to learn more about the methods required to be implemented by your custom content lock class.
