## Available presets

Kirby ships with the following blueprint presets that you can use to get started. They can help you to quickly get started with simple but very common blueprint layouts. For more complex and fully customized layouts check out our (link: docs/guide/blueprints/layout text: layout guide).

### Single page: `page`

For a typical single page setup (e.g. for articles, projects, text pages, etc.), you can use the `page` preset. It will set up form fields and a sidebar with subpages and files.


```yaml
title: Simple Page
preset: page
fields:
    headline:
        label: Headline
        type: text
    text:
        label: Text
        type: textarea
```

Besides defining form fields, you can also control the files and pages settings within this preset. (link: docs/reference/panel/presets/page text: Learn more ›)

The `page` preset is very close to Kirby 2 blueprints and the perfect starting point if you want to migrate an old project.

### Group of pages: `pages`

A collection of pages, such as a blog, projects or a shop, often does not really need form fields or files, but more features to manage subpages. The `pages` preset is perfect for such page types.

```yaml
title: Blog
preset: pages
```

You have a lot of additional options to configure the way subpages are displayed with this preset and which templates are allowed. (link: docs/reference/panel/presets/pages text: Learn more ›)

### Group of files: `files`

Some page types, such as photo albums or download sections, should focus entirely on the file management. That's what the `files` preset is made for.

```yaml
title: Gallery
preset: files
```

The `files` preset can do a lot more to set up the ratio, size, image cropping and info of each card. (link: docs/reference/panel/presets/files text: Learn more ›)
