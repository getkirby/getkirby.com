Intro: Move your Kirby 2 user accounts over to Kirby 3.

<info>
Migrating user accounts between version 2 and 3 is no trivial task and problems can occur. If you only have a few accounts, **consider creating them from scratch**. If that is not an option, the following instructions are a starting point to moving them over.
</info>

## A new approach to user accounts
The account structure differs significantly from version 2. In Kirby 3, accounts still live in `/site/accounts`. However, each account consists of a folder (named with a hash of its ID) and three files:

```filesystem
yMr6qjWF/
  .htpasswd
  index.php
  user.txt
```

The `.htpasswd` is used to store the encrypted password. The `index.php` contains system-critical data such as the email address, user name, language and role. Finally, the `user.txt` stores any additional user data.

## Migrate your accounts

To migrate your Kirby 2 user accounts to Kirby 3, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Backup** all Kirby 2 account files from `/site/accounts`. Things can go wrong. We do not want you to lose this important data.
2. **Create (link: docs/guide/users/roles#creating-your-own-roles text: user blueprints)** for every (link: docs/guide/users/roles text: user role). If you do not create these first, all user accounts will be assigned the role `nobody`.
3. Remove the `.logins` and `index.html` files from `/site/accounts`. Only your Kirby 2 account files should be left.
4. Put the following **`migrate.php` script** into your document root next to the `index.php` and run it by visiting `http://yourdomain.com/migrate.php`.
5. Delete the script.

<warning>
Kirby 3 requires passwords to be at least 8 characters long. If a password from Kirby 2 is shorter, users will not be able to log in with these old passwords. In those cases, please generate the hash of a new password with the `User::hashPassword()` method and write it manually to the corresponding `.htpasswd`.
</warning>

## The `migrate.php` script

```php "/migrate.php"
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/kirby/bootstrap.php';

$kirby = new Kirby;
$dir   = $kirby->root('accounts');

// authenticate as almighty
$kirby->impersonate('kirby');

// loop through each K2 account file
foreach (Dir::files($dir) as $account) {

    // read K2 account file
    $data  = Data::read($dir . '/' . $account, 'yaml');

    // prepare data to be processed
    $name        = $data['username'];
    $email       = $data['email'];
    $password    = $data['password'];
    $role        = $data['role'];
    $language    = $data['language'];

    unset(
        $data[0],
        $data['username'],
        $data['email'],
        $data['password'],
        $data['role'],
        $data['language'],
        $data['history']
    );

    // create new K3 user account
    $user = $kirby->users()->create([
        'email'    => $email,
        'name'     => $name,
        'role'     => $role,
        'language' => $language,
        'content'  => $data
    ]);

    // write K2 password hash to .htpasswd
    F::write($dir . '/' . $user->id() . '/.htpasswd', $password);

    // delete K2 account file
    F::remove($dir . '/' . $account);

    echo 'User migrated: ' . $user->email() . '<br>';
}
```

## Update user fields

If you have used user fields in Kirby 2 to store e.g. the author of a blog post, you will need to update these field values if you want to use them with the (link: docs/reference/panel/fields/users text: new `users` field). The following script helps you to update the fields after you have migrated all user accounts.

<warning>
Before you run this script, make sure to remove all title fields from your blueprints, otherwise your titles will be deleted.
</warning>

```php "/update-user-fields.php"
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/kirby/bootstrap.php';

$kirby = new Kirby;

// ATTENTION:
// If running into timeouts, change the following
// line to a smaller pages collection
$pages = $kirby->site()->index();

// authenticate as almighty
$kirby->impersonate('kirby');

// loop through each page
foreach ($pages as $page) {

    // get all fields for this page
    $fields = $page->blueprint()->fields();

    // loop through each field
    foreach ($fields as $field) {

        // only deal with user/s fields
        if (in_array($field['type'], ['users', 'user'])) {

            // get old username
            $name = $page->{$field['name']}();

            if ($name->isNotEmpty()) {

                // find user by old username
                if ($user = $kirby->users()->findBy('username', $name)) {

                    // update with email as identifier
                    $page->update([
                        $field['name'] => Yaml::encode([
                            $user->email()
                        ])
                    ]);

                } else {
                    echo 'User "' . $name . '" could not be found.<br>';
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
