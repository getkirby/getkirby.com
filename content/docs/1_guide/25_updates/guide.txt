To update Kirby, download the latest version and replace the `kirby` folder.

Make sure to delete the `media` folder. It will be automatically recreated.

If you use any plugins, make sure to update them as well.

That's it! Because Kirby does not use a database by default, you don't have to run any database migrations.

<warning>
Kirby uses the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) scheme:
{major}.{minor}(.{patch})

**Major releases** (e.g 4.0 to 5.0) may contain breaking changes and deprecations. In such a case, you might have to update your code and plugins used in your installation. You can find breaking changes of a new release in the changelogs. If you are updating from older versions, multiple changelogs may apply. Always read them carefully to identify potential issues.

**Minor and patch releases** (e.g. 4.1 to 4.2 or 4.1 to 4.1.1) can generally be applied without changes to your site code.

Note that the major version of Kirby 3 was the second number (e.g. the major version of Kirby 3.9.0 is 9). So e.g. updates from Kirby 3.8 to Kirby 3.9 also came with breaking changes.

In any case, please never update a live website directly on the server. Test updates locally first to see if something breaks.
