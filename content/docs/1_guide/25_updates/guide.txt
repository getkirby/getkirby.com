Text:

To update Kirby, download the latest version and replace the `kirby` folder.

Make sure to delete the `media` folder. It will be automatically recreated.

If you use any plugins, make sure to update them as well.

That's it! Because Kirby does not use a database by default, you don't have to run any database migrations.

<warning>
Kirby uses the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) scheme:
{major}.{minor}(.{patch})

**Major releases** (e.g 4.0 to 5.0) may contain breaking changes and deprecations. In such a case, you might have to update your code and plugins used in your installation. You can find breaking changes of a new release in the changelogs. If you are updating from older versions, multiple changelogs may apply. Always read them carefully to identify potential issues.

**Minor and patch releases** (e.g. 4.1 to 4.2 or 4.1 to 4.1.1) can generally be applied without changes to your site code.

In any case, please never update a live website directly on the server. Test updates locally first to see if something breaks.
