Title: Plugin best practices

Intro: A collection of tips how to structure, name, tag, describe and promote your plugin

Text:

Now that you have learned a lot about plugins and have decided to start developing your own, here are some best practices that will make it easier for users to find and use your plugins, and also for you to maintain it and maybe even understand your own code later on 😉.

## Structure

### Basic plugins

```filesystem
plugins/
  pluginname/
    index.php
```

### Plugin with own classes

```filesystem
plugins/
  pluginname/
    lib/
      MyClass.php
    index.php
    vendor/
```

### Basic Panel plugin

```filesystem
plugins/
  pluginname/
    index.php
    index.js
    composer.json
```

### Panel plugin with components

```filesystem
plugins/
  pluginname/
    src/
      assets/
        styles.css
      components/
        Fields/
          Field.vue
        Sections/
          Section.vue
        ...
      index.js
    index.php
    index.js (auto-generated)
```

For more complex plugins, add other subfolders as required.

## Commenting

Comments help you and your users to understand your code even years later and they make it easier for other developers if they want to contribute to your plugin's development. Documenting comments will allow you to auto-generate documentation of your classes and methods (where applicable).

## Naming

While you are free to name your plugin whatever you like, it makes sense to give your repo a name that immediately makes it clear that your plugin is for the Kirby CMS. Most developers name their repos `kirby3-pluginname` or `kirby-pluginname`.

The plugin name itself ideally reveals the purpose of the plugin.

## Description

Add a good description to your plugin repo so that people looking for a specific plugin will immediately get what the plugin actually does.

## Tagging

On GitHub, you can tag your plugins. Don't forget to add the following tags in addition to those that describe the purpose of your plugin:

- kirby3
- kirby-cms
- kirby-plugin

## Versioning

Use (link: https://semver.org/ text: semantic versioning):

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes

### Add `composer.json`

Add a composer.json file with basic information about your plugin, including the current version number, so that users can easily get information about your plugin with Kirby's plugin methods.

```js "composer.json"
{
    "name": "superwoman/superplugin",
    "description": "Superwoman Demo Plugin",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "license": "MIT",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Superwoman",
            "email": "superwoman@example.com"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Add a README

In your README, describe the plugin in every little detail and how to use it:

1. What is the purpose of the plugin and who profits from using it?
2. How can the plugin be installed?
3. How can users use the plugin? Ideally, add step by step instructions, not just a few examples. This is particularly important if using the plugin requires some background knowledge or user code.
4. Are there any config settings? If so, what is each config setting good for?

The easier you make it for users to use your plugin, the more likely they will actually use it, star it and maybe even buy you a beer or two.

## Add a license

Don't forget to add the license under which your plugin is published and if it is free or commercial.

If it is free but you want people to donate, add a link to the platform where you want them to donate or offer some options.

## Promote your plugin

- Create an new topic in the (link: https://forum.getkirby.com/c/plugins/kirby-3/ text: Kirby 3 plugins category on the forum), ping @texnixe to make sure she'll mention it in the next Kosmos issue.
- Submit it to the (link: /plugins text: Kirby plugins directory), currently either by making a PR to the (link: https://github.com/getkirby/getkirby.com text: getkirby.com repo) or by creating an issue, but we will add a submit form in the future.
- Tweet it mentioning @getkirby.
