Title: Plugin setup for Panel plugins

----

Intro: Our Panel is based on Vue.js and your Panel plugins will be built with Vue as well. You can create your plugins without a build process, but if you want to use Vue's genius single file components and a more comfortable setup, we've got you covered.

<info>
Our Pluginkit for Panel plugins is almost identical to the basic setup – except the JavaScript parts. If you haven't built a Kirby plugin yet, we recommend to read the (link: ./plugin-setup-basic text: basic setup guide) first to get an idea of the general architecture.

## Installation

We have created a simple example plugin called the Pluginkit. You can find the code for this tutorial in the (link: https://github.com/getkirby/pluginkit/tree/4-panel text: `4-panel`) branch.

If you want to follow along, you can download a (link: https://github.com/getkirby/pluginkit/archive/4-panel.zip text: **ZIP file**) of that branch or get it via Composer:

```
composer create-project getkirby/pluginkit site/plugins/your-plugin dev-4-panel --remove-vcs
```

Note: Composer is not required to follow this tutorial.

## Introducing kirbyup

For our development and production process, we use a bundler called (link: https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirbyup text: kirbyup). It is tailored for Kirby Panel plugins, utilizing [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) under the hood, and works right of the box. It will help to compile Vue's single file components, convert SASS in your style blocks, minify your code when you build your plugin and more.

You don't even have to install kirbyup. When running your first npm command, kirbyup will be remotely fetched and available for all subsequent commands. The initial package fetching might take a moment.

## Development process

You can start the development process in your plugin directory with:

```
npm run dev
```

This will automatically create your plugin's `index.js` and `index.css` and keep those files updated whenever you make changes.

### The `src` folder

Your Panel plugin code is located in the `src` folder. Your main plugin file is `src/index.js`. In that file you can import Vue components and define all your different plugin types. In our example setup, we've created a simple custom view that will appear in the Panel's main menu. But you can use this for fields, sections or any other type of Panel plugin of course.

### Panel reloading

To inspect changes made by your plugin, you will have to trigger a manual reload in your Panel. kirbyup doesn't support hot module reloading yet, wants to in the future.

## Building your plugin

Once you are happy with your plugin, you can create minified and optimized versions of the `index.js` and `index.css` with:

```
npm run build
```
