Title: Login methods

----

Intro: Kirby allows login with email and password and passwordless via a login code or to reset your password. These configurable login methods are different ways of getting into the Panel.

## Available methods

Kirby comes with three login methods you can choose from:

1. **Password (`password`)**
The user gets a login form with email and password fields. It is also possible to combine the password with a second factor or step (for example a code sent via email).

2. **Passwordless login (`code`)**
Here, the login form only has an email field. Instead of logging in with the user's password, the user gets asked for a login code that is sent via email by default or can be generated by plugins. You might know this way of logging in from services like Notion or from our [feedback site](https://feedback.getkirby.com).

3. **Password reset (`password-reset`)**
This method is very similar to the passwordless login, but the purpose is different: After logging in with the code, the user will be redirected to the (link: docs/guide/authentication/password-reset-form text: password reset form). After confirming the new password, the user is redirected to the Panel dashboard.

You can learn more about how to configure the login methods in the (link: docs/reference/system/options/auth#login-methods text: reference).

If you don't configure the login methods, Kirby will enable the `password` method by default. Passwordless login via a code is only possible if you enable it in the configuration.

## Email Templates

You can overwrite our standard email templates for code verification and password reset by placing the following email templates in `/site/templates/emails/auth`:

### Login via code

**HTML template:**
`/site/templates/emails/auth/login.html.php`

**Text template:**
`/site/templates/emails/auth/login.php`

**Default email text:**
```php "Subject: Your login code"
Hi <?= $user->nameOrEmail() ?>,

You recently requested a login code for the Kirby Panel.
The following login code will be valid for <?= $timeout ?> minutes:

<?= $code ?>

If you did not request a login code, please ignore this email or contact your administrator if you have questions.
For security, please DO NOT forward this email.
```

### Password reset

**HTML template:**
`/site/templates/emails/auth/password-reset.html.php`

**Text template:**
`/site/templates/emails/auth/password-reset.php`

**Default email text:**
```php "Subject: Your password reset code"
Hi <?= $user->nameOrEmail() ?>,

You recently requested a password reset code for the Kirby Panel.
The following password reset code will be valid for <?= $timeout ?> minutes:

<?= $code ?>

If you did not request a password reset code, please ignore this email or contact your administrator if you have questions.
For security, please DO NOT forward this email.
```

<info>
Our default templates are translated into our Panel languages. Kirby will automatically pick the best language for the email text (the configured user language, the (link: docs/reference/system/options/panel#default-panel-language text: default `panel.language`) or the default site language of a multilang site). The `panel.language` option is also used for the login UI.
