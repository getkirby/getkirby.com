## Debug mode

Kirby honours your PHP error logging settings by default. If you've switched off error logging, you won't get any errors and might end up with a white screen.

Especially on your local machine, we recommend to switch on error logging in your `php.ini`. Kirby also has a (link: /docs/reference/system/options/debug text: built-in option) which tries to enforce this:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
<?php
return [
    'debug' => true
];
```

Add this to `/site/config/config.php` in order to show errors immediately.

<alert>
Make sure to disable `debug` mode in production! Displaying PHP errors on a public server can be a serious security risk:

- Error messages are displayed with detailed information about the code structure (e.g. file path, class, method)
- With Whoops enabled, there will be even more detailed information about the code structure
- Detailed error messages for login failures could leak information to attackers

In a production environment, always log errors to your PHP error logs.
</alert>


## var_dump

If you need to inspect one of Kirby's objects, such as `$site`, `$page` or any `$file`, we recommend to use `var_dump`:

```php
var_dump($page);
```

It's a bit like PHP's equivalent of `console.log()` in JavaScript.

The output of `var_dump()` will be massively improved if you have (link: https://xdebug.org text: Xdebug) installed on your machine. Xdebug is most likely pre-installed if you use MAMP.

## Bugs

If you run into an issue that you can't fix yourself and which seems like a Kirby bug, please post it on the (link: https://forum.getkirby.com/c/issues text: forum in the issues category). We will take it from there and either try to help you out or move it to our official issue tracker on GitHub if it really turns out to be a bug.
