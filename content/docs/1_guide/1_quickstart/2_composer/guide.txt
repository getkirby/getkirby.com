## What is Composer?

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org) is a dependency manager for PHP. If you know [npm](https://www.npmjs.com), it's exactly that but for PHP. It allows you to install and update dependencies with simple commands on the command line.

## About this tutorial

This guide describes one of several ways you can install and update Kirby. See (link: docs/guide/installation text: the overview page) for all supported ways.

## Installing Composer

If you have never used Composer before, you first need to install it. Please follow the [instructions on the Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).

## Starting a new project

Once you have installed Composer, run the following command to set up a new Kirby installation with the Starterkit:

```bash
composer create-project getkirby/starterkit your-project
```

You can alternatively set up the Plainkit if you want:

```bash
composer create-project getkirby/plainkit your-project
```

All Composer packages are generally installed in the `vendor` directory. Kirby however is automatically installed in the `kirby` directory, so that you can get started right away.

It is [generally recommended](https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md) to exclude the `vendor` as well as the `kirby` directory from version control. If you use Git, add them to your `.gitignore` file. Your `.gitignore` should now look something like this:

```
...

/kirby
/vendor

...
```

## Switching an existing Kirby 4 site to a Composer setup

If you have an existing site and want to use Composer with it, that's possible as well.

The Composer magic is all contained in the `composer.json` file. The most basic version looks like this:

```js "composer.json"
{
  "require": {
    "getkirby/cms": "^4.0"
  },
  "config": {
    "optimize-autoloader": true
  }
}
```

Save this file in the root of your Kirby project and run the following command:

```
composer install
```

## Installing Kirby to a custom directory

If you want to use a different location for the `kirby` directory, you can change it in your `composer.json`:

```js "composer.json"
{
  "require": {
    "getkirby/cms": "^4.0"
  },
  "config": {
    "optimize-autoloader": true
  },
  "extra": {
    "kirby-cms-path": "kirby" // change this to your custom path
  }
}
```

Afterwards update the installation with:

```bash
cd your-project
composer update
```

You will also need to modify your site's `index.php` so that it can find the Kirby installation:

```php "index.php"
<?php

require '<your-path>/bootstrap.php';

echo (new Kirby)->render();
```

If you moved the `kirby` directory to a different directory level (outside of the webroot or into a subdirectory), you will also need to override the `index` root like so:

```php "index.php"
<?php

require '<your-path>/bootstrap.php';

echo (new Kirby([
  'roots' => [
    'index' => __DIR__
  ]
]))->render();
```

## Disabling the custom path completely

If you prefer to have the CMS installed to the `vendor` directory, you can disable the custom path entirely:

```js "composer.json"
{
  "require": {
    "getkirby/cms": "^3.0"
  },
  "config": {
    "optimize-autoloader": true
  },
  "extra": {
    "kirby-cms-path": false
  }
}
```

The `index.php` file needs to be changed so that it can find Kirby and so that Kirby can find the site data:

```php "index.php"
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

echo (new Kirby([
  'roots' => [
    'index' => __DIR__
  ]
]))->render();
````

## Updating Kirby

If you want to update Kirby to the latest version, all you need to do is to run the following command:

```bash
composer update getkirby/cms
```

Composer will now look for the latest version that matches your version constraint in the `composer.json` file. You can learn more about this in the [Composer documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md).

By changing the Kirby version in your `composer.json`, you can make Composer install a different version of Kirby. Very useful is the special version `dev-develop`, which will install the current development version of Kirby straight from GitHub.

## Using Composer for Kirby plugins

### Installing plugins with Composer

Many Kirby 3 plugins also support installation via Composer. As you now have a Composer setup, you only need to add them to your `composer.json` file and run `composer update`. This will automatically install the plugins to the `site/plugins` directory for you.

Alternatively, you can run `composer require <plugin-name>`, which will install the plugin and add it to your `composer.json` for you.

If you want, you can add the plugin to your `.gitignore` file. If you prefer, you can skip this step and commit the plugin code to your site repo (e.g. if you want to enable other team members to work on the site without having to run Composer or if you don't want to run Composer when deploying your site).

### Custom `plugins` directory path

If your `plugins` directory is in a non-standard location, you can change it like this:

```js "composer.json"
{
  "require": {
    "getkirby/cms": "^3.0",
    "superwoman/superplugin": "^1.0"
  },
  "config": {
    "optimize-autoloader": true
  },
  "extra": {
    "kirby-plugin-path": "site/plugins" // change this to your custom path
  }
}
```

## Using Composer for other dependencies

Of course, you can also install other dependencies like general PHP libraries this way. The libraries you install will automatically be available from your site's code, e.g. in your templates, controllers and models.
