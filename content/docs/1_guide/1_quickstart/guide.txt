<info>
When copying files to a remote server via (S)FTP, make sure to copy the `.htaccess` file as well. By default, files starting with a dot are invisible in the filesystem, so make sure enable the display of invisible files before copying.
</info>


## Create your first account

Kirby's control panel (aka. the Panel) comes without any pre-installed accounts. Open `http://yourdomain.com/panel` in the browser to start the installer and create the first account.

<warning>
For security reasons, you cannot install the Panel on a public server by default. To allow this, you can enable the (link: docs/reference/system/options/panel#allow-the-panel-to-be-installed-on-a-remote-server text: `panel.install` option).
</warning>

## Purchase license & activate your installation

Once you publish your website, you need to (link: buy text: purchase a Kirby license). We will send you a unique license code for your domain. You can activate your license with the following steps:

(tabs…)
=== In the Panel

1. Open the Panel at `http://yourdomain.com/panel` and log in.
2. Click on "Activate" on the bottom left.
3. Enter your license code and your email address and press "Ok".

=== Without using the Panel

If you don’t want the Panel to connect to our server, registration via the Panel fails, or you are not using the Panel at all, you can download your license files directly from our licenses website:

1. Visit (link: https://hub.getkirby.com).
2. Log in with the email you used when you purchased the license and any order number.
3. In the list of your licenses, click on the key you want to activate.
4. Use the "Download license file" button to download the license file.
5. Rename the downloaded file to `.license` (without extensions).
6. Place it in the `/site/config/` folder of your Kirby installation.
