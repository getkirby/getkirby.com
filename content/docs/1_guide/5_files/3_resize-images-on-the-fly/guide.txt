Title: Image thumbnails

----

Intro: Kirby's built-in thumb creator lets you resize and crop any image on the fly in your templates. You can not only resize and crop images from the content folder, but also from the assets folder directly.

----

Text:

With Kirby's Thumbnail API, thumbs are generated asynchronously. This makes thumb creation feel a lot faster and creates less memory issues, which could easily become an issue with many images or when creating many different images sizes to serve responsive images.

A new set of plugin extensions can be used to hook into the thumbnail API or the thumbnail URLs, see (link: docs/reference/plugins/extensions/core-components text: core components).


## The `thumb()` method

With the thumb method, you can perform multiple image manipulations at once: resizing, cropping, changing the image format, converting to grayscale, and blurring. If you wanted to do everything at once, the code would look like this:

```php
<img src="<?= $image->thumb(
    [
        'width'     => 300,
        'height'    => 300,
        'crop'      => 'center',
        'format'    => 'webp',
        'grayscale' => true,
        'blur'      => 300,
        'sharpen'   => 50,
        'quality'   => 70,
    ]
)->url() ?>" alt="">
```

In the Reference: (link: docs/reference/objects/cms/file/thumb text: $file->thumb())

## Shortcut methods

Most of the time, you don't want to use all options though. On top, the thumb method is quite verbose. Luckily, Kirby comes with a set of  shortcuts methods: `resize()`, `crop()`, `grayscale()`, and `blur()`. Additionally, you can define default settings in your config file. But one step after the other.

Here are some examples for using the shortcut methods, more details with all options in the Reference:

### Resizing images

```php
$image->resize(300);
$image->resize(300, 200);
```
In the Reference: (link: docs/reference/objects/cms/file/resize text: $file->resize())

### Cropping images

```php
$image->crop(100);
$image->crop(100, 200);
```

Kirby will automatically use a (link: docs/reference/panel/blueprints/file#en-disable-setting-focus-in-panel text: focus point) set for the image when set, otherwise use the default thumb settings.

In the Reference: (link: docs/reference/objects/cms/file/crop text: $file->crop())

### Blur

The `blur` method applies a blur filter to an image. You can modify the intensity of the blur effect by passing an integer. The default value is 10.

```php
$image->blur();
$image->blur(30);
```
In the Reference: (link: docs/reference/objects/cms/file/blur text: $file->blur())

### Grayscale

The grayscale method converts an image to grayscale.

```php
$image->grayscale();
```
In the Reference: (link: docs/reference/objects/cms/file/grayscale text: $file->grayscale())

## Configuring your thumbnails

Options for thumbnails are set with the `thumbs` key in Kirby's configuration:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'thumbs' => [
    'driver'    => 'im',
    'quality'   => 90,
    'bin'       => '/usr/local/bin/convert',
    'interlace' => true,
    'format'    => 'webp',
  ]
];
```

In the Reference: (link: docs/reference/system/options/thumbs text: All thumbs options)

## Presets

You can define option presets for thumbs in your `config.php`:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
    'thumbs' => [
        'presets' => [
            'default' => ['width' => 1024, 'quality' => 80],
            'blurred' => ['blur' => true]
        ]
    ]
];
```

Then you can use these presets e.g. in your templates:

```php
$file->thumb(); // for default preset
$file->thumb('blurred');
```

## Responsive images
You can use Kirby's [`$image->srcset()`](/docs/reference/objects/file/srcset) method to easily create the `srcset` attribute for responsive images. (link: docs/reference/objects/file/srcset text: Learn more ›)

```php
<img srcset="<?= $image->srcset([300, 800, 1024]) ?>">
```

Check out our cookbook recipe (link: docs/cookbook/performance/responsive-images text: Responsive images) to learn more.

## Image formats

You can use the `format` option to convert an existing JPEG, GIF or PNG into a WebP or AVIF file with the `thumb()` method.

```php
<?= $image->thumb(['width' => 200, 'format' => 'webp']) ?>
<?= $image->thumb(['width' => 200, 'format' => 'avif']) ?>
```

The format option can also be used in srcset definitions.

```php

$image->srcset([
  '400w'  => ['width' => 400, 'format' => 'webp'],
  '800w'  => ['width' => 800, 'format' => 'webp'],
  '1200w' => ['width' => 1200, 'format' => 'webp']
])
```

## Responsive images

With Kirby's thumb engine, you can resize, crop and otherwise manipulate images. Here are the links to relevant resources:

## Thumbnail storage

In a default setup, thumbnails are stored in the `/media` folder.

They are placed in subfolders named based on a combination of the file's modification timestamp and the hash generated by `$kirby->contentToken()`.

By default, this depends on the full file system path of the file, so it will likely differ between your local and remote setup. For example, if you want to pre-render thumbnails locally and upload them to your remote server, you will need to set the (link: docs/reference/system/options/content#salt-for-drafts-and-media-files text: `content.salt` option) on both instances so that the hash is the same and thumbnails aren't re-generated.
