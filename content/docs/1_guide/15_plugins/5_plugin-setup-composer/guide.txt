Title: Plugin setup with Composer dependencies

----

Intro: If your plugin depends on a library you have required via Composer, that library needs to be available with the ZIP download and Git submodule methods as well. Let's see how.

## The Pluginkit: Our example plugin

There is a Pluginkit example plugin for this tutorial as well. You can find its code in the [`3-composer`](https://github.com/getkirby/pluginkit/tree/3-composer) branch of the Pluginkit.

If you want to follow along, you can [download a ZIP file of that branch](https://github.com/getkirby/pluginkit/archive/3-composer.zip) or get it via Composer:

```bash
composer create-project getkirby/pluginkit site/plugins/your-plugin dev-3-composer --remove-vcs
```

## Adding Composer dependencies

Let's say your plugin requires a (fictional) library that is published as the Composer package `superwoman/superlibrary`. To add it as a dependency, run the following commands:

```bash
cd site/plugins/your-plugin
composer require superwoman/superlibrary
```

Composer will now install the library to your `vendor` directory and add the library to your `composer.json` file for you:

```js "composer.json"
{
    "name": "getkirby/pluginkit",
    "description": "Kirby Example Plugin",
    "license": "MIT",
    "type": "kirby-plugin",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Your Name",
            "email": "you@example.com"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "getkirby/composer-installer": "^1.1",
        "superwoman/superlibrary": "^5.0"
    },
    "config": {
        "optimize-autoloader": true
    }
}
```

## Support for plugin installation without Composer

By adding the dependency to the `composer.json` file, the library will be automatically installed together with your plugin if the user of your plugin uses Composer to do so.

The issue is that the library's code won't be available if the plugin is installed via a Git submodule or manually. For that, you need to include the code in your Git repository by modifying the rules in the `.gitignore` file.

We have prepared a set of rules that still ignores most files that are not necessary, but includes all relevant files of your dependencies:

```bash ".gitignore"
# ...

# files of Composer dependencies that are not needed for the plugin
/vendor/**/.*
/vendor/**/*.json
/vendor/**/*.txt
/vendor/**/*.md
/vendor/**/*.yml
/vendor/**/*.yaml
/vendor/**/*.xml
/vendor/**/*.dist
/vendor/**/readme.php
/vendor/**/LICENSE
/vendor/**/COPYING
/vendor/**/VERSION
/vendor/**/docs/*
/vendor/**/example/*
/vendor/**/examples/*
/vendor/**/test/*
/vendor/**/tests/*
/vendor/**/php4/*
/vendor/getkirby/composer-installer
```

The next step is to load the Composer autoloader from your plugin's `index.php` file. This will automatically load the required libraries when needed:

```php "index.php"
@include_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
```

Note that you should *not* `require` the autoloader, as it will only be present if the plugin is installed manually or via a Git submodule. Our custom Composer installer will delete the `vendor` directories from plugins to avoid code duplication and autoloading issues. By using `@include_once`, you tell PHP to load the file only if it exists.

## Using the Composer autoloader for plugin classes

Now that you are using the Composer autoloader anyway, you might as well use it for your plugin's own classes as well instead of using Kirby's autoloader like in the (link: docs/guide/plugins/plugin-setup-autoloader text: plugin setup with autoloader).

First step is to add the classes and files to load to your plugin's `composer.json`:

```js "composer.json"
{
    "name": "getkirby/pluginkit",
    "description": "Kirby Example Plugin",
    "license": "MIT",
    "type": "kirby-plugin",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Your Name",
            "email": "you@example.com"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "getkirby/composer-installer": "^1.1",
        "superwoman/superlibrary": "^5.0"
    },
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "Superwoman\\Superplugin\\": "src/"
        }
    },
    "config": {
        "optimize-autoloader": true
    }
}
```

Besides `PSR-4`, Composer provides several [other options](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#autoload) for autoloading.

When you are done configuring, you need to run `composer install` again to regenerate Composer's autoloader. Afterwards commit the changes Composer made to the `vendor` directory to your Git repo.
