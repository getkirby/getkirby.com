Title: Roles

----

Intro: Kirby's user management is based on a simple role system. By default, Kirby is configured to provide just an admin role, but you can add your own roles. Roles can be assigned to users in the users section of the Panel.

Text:

## Admins

The admin role is mandatory and cannot be removed. Users with that role have all permissions, while other roles might have limited permissions.

## Creating your own roles

To create a new user role, add a new user blueprint to `/site/blueprints/users`:

```filesystem
/site/blueprints/users/admin.yml
/site/blueprints/users/editor.yml
/site/blueprints/users/reviewer.yml
```
Each user blueprint must have a `title`. Other content - like custom form fields or permission settings - are optional.

The user role blueprint can be used to set additional custom user fields for each user role, as well as to define (link: docs/guide/users/permissions text: permissions) based on this role.

Example user blueprint:

```yaml "/site/blueprints/users/default.yml"
title: Default
