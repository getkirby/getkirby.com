## Decoupling responsibilities

Like many other CMSs, Kirby has a backend part (the Panel and the file system) where your data is stored and managed, and a frontend part (templates, snippets, controllers) that is responsible for getting the data from the backend and presenting it to the website visitors.

This combination is perfectly fine for most website projects.


However, if you have use cases where you…

- Want to feed multiple channels (that may even include printing) from a single source of truth
- Want to use frameworks like Vue.js or React for your application
- Want to use static site generators
- Want to be more independent in terms of programming languages
- etc.

…then you can decouple the data processing and storage of your CMS backend from your frontend, you basically cut off the head, hence the buzzword "headless CMS". Your CMS backend and your decoupled frontend then communicate via an API, usually providing JSON data.

With Kirby, you have several options to run in "headless" mode.

1. Content representations
2. Kirby's REST API
3. The KQL plugin

The following is an introduction to each of these options and an overview of their uses.

## Content representations

Content representations work like standard Kirby templates and are usually bound to a page type. They are a great way to create an API that provides exactly the data you need.

By default, content representations are publicly accessible, so they're great for content that is only accessed via GET requests. However, you can of course add authentication if needed or lock your API server-side to prevent unauthorized access.

The (only) downside to this approach is that you need to invest some extra work in creating the JSON templates.

### When to use

- You want an easy-to-implement way to get data from Kirby without having to worry about authentication
- You want full control over the output
- You don't mind the extra effort

## REST API

The REST API was originally designed for use with the Panel (and is of course tailored for that purpose), but it can also be used by you and even extended. However, REST has the problem that it is very limited compared to the flexibility we usually have in Kirby.

The REST API is great for getting a set of data like a list of users or pages. It's also great when you need to change data with CRUD operations: create pages, delete pages, add files, etc., and that's what we're mainly using it for right now.

Every request to the REST API requires authentication. For remote requests from another site Kirby supports HTTP Basic Auth, for authentication from the same site or domain you can use session-based authentication.


You can extend the REST API with your own custom endpoints which means great flexibility. Your custom  endpoints are automatically protected with the same authentication layer as the default endpoints.

<warning>
It is not recommended to use HTTP Basic Auth in combination with JavaScript front-ends, as you will be exposing your credentials. While there are examples in the wild that implement this via a Panel user with no privileges, this is not the way Basic Auth should be used.
</warning>

### When to use

Using the REST API is the way to go if you want to modify data.

## KQL

With KQL, you don't need to write backend code. Your frontend can retrieve the data you need without any changes to the backend. This brings a lot of flexibility and you hardly need to leave your frontend code. For authentication, the same methods are used as for the REST API. KQL supports only a subset of Kirby's API, i.e. non-destructive commands.

KQL allows you to fully customize results to your application needs.


### When to use

- You want to leverage Kirby's API, but without the hassle
- You do not need to modify any data

## Custom routes

For completeness sake, let's not forget routes. Routes could also be an option for simple data models, e.g. for use cases where you want to provide a limited set of data from a single endpoint. This approach probably works best if you use Kirby as a standard CMS but want to re-use some data for other purposes.

## Where to go from here

As we have seen, Kirby gives you the freedom of choice when it comes to operating in headless mode. Each of the methods presented has its advantages and disadvantages, and which of the options is best for you will largely depend on your specific requirements.

The different methods can even be combined, or you can use headless mode in addition to the traditional approach as a full CMS.

Here are a few more resources that can help you get started or give you more ideas for implementing your own solutions. We will update this list on an ongoing basis.
