Title: Permissions

----

Intro: User permissions help you to restrict access and capabilities for specific user roles – in the (glossary: Panel) as well as when using Kirby's (link: docs/guide/templates/php-api text: PHP API) or (link: docs/guide/api/authentication text: REST API).

## Defining permissions

Permissions in Kirby can be defined in two places:

1. In a user blueprint for each role
2. In the page, file or the site blueprint for more detailed rules

## Role based permissions in user blueprints

Each role can have its own blueprint with custom fields for users with that role and optional user permissions. User blueprints are stored in `/site/blueprints/users` and get the name of each role (i.e `/site/blueprints/users/editor.yml`).

Permissions are only valid for custom roles. The admin role does not obey to those settings and can always do anything.

Here is an overview of all available permissions:

```yaml "/site/blueprints/users/editor.yml"
title: Editor
permissions:
  access:
    account: true
    panel: true
    site: true
    languages: true
    system: true
    users: true
  files:
    create: true
    changeName: true
    changeTemplate: true
    delete: true
    read: true
    replace: true
    update: true
  languages:
    create: true
    delete: true
  pages:
    access: true
    changeSlug: true
    changeStatus: true
    changeTemplate: true
    changeTitle: true
    create: true
    delete: true
    list: true
    move: true
    duplicate: true
    preview: true
    read: true
    sort: true
    update: true
  site:
    changeTitle: true
    preview: true
    update: true
  user:
    changeEmail: true
    changeLanguage: true
    changeName: true
    changePassword: true
    changeRole: true
    delete: true
    update: true
  users:
    changeEmail: true
    changeLanguage: true
    changeName: true
    changePassword: true
    changeRole: true
    create: true
    delete: true
    update: true
```

### Access to language view
In a multi-language installation, you can control access to the language view by role with the new access permissions:

```yaml
# users/editor.yml
title: Editor
permissions:
  access:
    languages: false
```

### Access to system view

To control access to the system view by role, use the system access permissions:

```yaml
# users/editor.yml
title: Editor
permissions:
  access:
    system: false
```


<info>
The `user` permission only applies to the user itself, while the `users` permissions sets these permissions for all users.
</info>

You don't have to set all permissions for each role. Each permission is set to `true` by default, if not specified otherwise.

You can also enable or disable entire permission sections by passing `true` or `false` instead of an array of definitions for each action. A more simple permission setup for an editor, who should not be allowed to edit other users, could look like this:

```yaml "/site/blueprints/users/editor.yml"
title: Editor
permissions:
  site:
    update: false
  pages:
    delete: false
  users: false
  user:
    changeRole: false
```

This would prevent the editor from editing other users (`users: false`), from changing their own role, from deleting pages and from updating the site settings.

## The `*` wildcard

For permission types with many actions with the same setting, you can use the * wildcard as first argument. Afterwards you can still override specific actions, for example to whitelist actions:

```yaml
user:
  *: false
  changeName: true
```

## Visitors without Panel access

Frontend users can also be managed through the Panel, but you most likely don't want them to be able to access the Panel at all. In order to achieve this, set Panel access to `false`.

```yaml
title: Visitor
permissions:
  access:
    panel: false
```

If you use any of Kirby's (link: docs/guide/templates/php-api text: PHP APIs) in the frontend to modify pages, files, the site or users, you should set the permissions like above to control what a visitor can do in your frontend. You can also have multiple frontend user roles without access to the Panel but with different access rights to the PHP APIs. Our (link: docs/guide/api/authentication text: REST API) follows the same rules.

## Specific permissions in page, file, user or site options

You can keep all permissions in the role files, but you can also overwrite them individually per page, file, user or the site in the corresponding blueprints. Those specific permission settings will always override the role settings.

### Page options


```yaml "/site/blueprints/pages/project.yml"
title: Project

options:
  changeTemplate: false
  changeTitle: false
  update: true
  delete: false
```

You can control each option for pages, files and users in blueprints with fine-grained permissions based on user role:

```yaml
options:
  delete:
    admin: true
    editor: false
```

You can also use a wildcard to change the default for all roles and then assign exceptions to individual roles:

```yaml
options:
  update:
    *: false
    editor: true
```


## Controlling permissions with hooks

If the blueprint-based permission settings are too limiting for your project, you can get more flexibility by creating your own permission checks with `before` hooks for various actions.

```php "/site/config/config.php"

return [
  'hooks' => [
    'page.delete:before' => function (Page $page) {
      if ($this->user()->email() !== 'overlord@ourcompany.com') {
        throw new Exception('Only our overlord and savior can delete pages');
      }
    }
  ]
];
```

Of course this can be more complex and sophisticated than that, but it's a good first start.

## Authenticate or impersonate

To obtain the required permissions for certain actions, you can  authenticate as a user by logging in. If you want to run actions programmatically without logging in, you can also impersonate a user.

### Authentication

Users can log in through the (glossary: Panel) login page or a custom login form. To learn more about how to log in a user programmatically, read the reference for (link: docs/reference/objects/user/login text: $user->login()).

### Impersonate

One way to go without authentication is to (link: docs/reference/objects/kirby/impersonate text: impersonate) an existing user or the special `kirby` super user, which has full permissions:

```php
<?php

$kirby = kirby();
$kirby->impersonate('kirby');

page('notes/a-great-article')->update([
  'author' => 'Homer Simpson'
]);
```

<warning>
The impersonation will be active for all code that runs in the current request after the call to `$kirby->impersonate()`. If you want to limit the impact to a single operation, call the method with a callback (see below).
</warning>

#### Impersonate with callback

If you only want a single operation to run with different privileges, use a callback:

```php
<?php

$kirby = kirby();
$result = $kirby->impersonate('kirby', function () {
  page('notes/a-great-article')->update([
    'author' => 'Homer Simpson'
  ]);

  return 'this will be returned to $result above';
});
```

The impersonation automatically gets reset to the previous value after the callback returns.


#### Disable all permissions

It is also possible to disable all permissions, even if a user is currently logged in. This is useful for operations where you want to ensure that no changes are made to the site (read-only access):

```php
<?php

$kirby = kirby();
$kirby->impersonate('nobody');

// later in the code: an unwanted update, which will now fail
page('notes/a-great-article')->update([
  'author' => 'Homer Simpson'
]);
```
