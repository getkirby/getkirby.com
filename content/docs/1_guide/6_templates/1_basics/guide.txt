## TL;DR

- All templates are stored in the `/site/templates` folder
- To create a new template for a page, create a .php file with a filename that matches the filename of the content file
- You can use the `$page`, `$site` and `$pages` variables to easily access the content of your pages/site


## Naming your templates

When you open a page in the browser, Kirby reads the name of the text file to determine what template to use to render the page. If Kirby finds a template with the same name as the text file, it loads it and executes the code contained in it. If there is no matching template, the default template is used instead.

<warning>
Template names must be lowercase, for example `default.php` or `blog.php`.
</warning>

Here are some example of content file and template file counterparts:

| Text file                               | Template                     |
| -                                       | -                            |
| /content/home/home.txt                  | /site/templates/home.php     |
| /content/projects/projects.txt          | /site/templates/projects.php |
| /content/projects/project-1/project.txt | /site/templates/project.php  |
| /content/projects/project-2/project.txt | /site/templates/project.php  |

## The default template

The default template is the only required template. It is called `default.php` and must exist in your `/site/templates` folder. When you get started with a completely new site you might want to start with just the default template as your foundation.

## Shared templates

Pages with the same or a similar content structure can share a single template. For example, all the notes subpages in the `/notes` page or the album subpages of the `/photography` page of the Starterkit share the same template called `note.php` and `album.php` respectively.


## Basic usage

Let's start with looking at a very simple HTML template and how we can replace parts of it with the content of our text files.

```html
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>My first page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello world!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Nothing very special here, just a static HTML page with a title tag in the head and a headline in the body.

Kirby provides some API variables for each template that are instantly available and allow us to fetch content from our pages, namely the `$site`, the `$page` and the `$pages` variables.

## The `$site` variable

The `$site` object contains important information about the site in general and the data stored in `/content/site.txt`. Let's replace the hard-coded document title with something more dynamic:

```php
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title><?= $site->title()->html() ?></title>
</head>
<body>
  Hello world!
</body>
</html>
```

With `$site->title()` we fetch the value  of the title field from `/content/site.txt`.

The `site.txt` file of the Starterkit looks like this:


```kirbycontent "/content/site.txt"
Title: Kirby Starterkit

\----

Author: Content Folder GmbH & Co. KG

\----

Description: This is Kirby's Starterkit.

\----

Copyright: © 2009–(date: Year) (link: http://getkirby.com text: The Kirby Team)
```

The above code would therefore render "Kirby Starterkit" as our document title.


The `$site` object is the perfect place for storing any data that you want to reuse throughout your site. Next to typical things like data for the title and description meta tags, you can also store copyright information or social media accounts.


All this data can be used in your templates instantly:

```php
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="description" content="<?= $site->description()->html() ?>">
  <title>
    <?= $site->title()->html() ?>
  </title>
</head>
<body>

  <header>
    <h1 class="logo">
      <a href="<?= $site->url() ?>">
        <?= $site->title()->html() ?>
      </a>
    </h1>
  </header>

  Hello world!

  <footer>
    <p class="copyright"><?= $site->copyright()->html() ?></p>
  </footer>

</body>
</html>
```

As you can see, the `$site` object also contains the main URL of your site, which can be used to link the logo back to your homepage for example. The `$site` object has many more methods you can find in the (link: docs/reference text: Reference).

## The `$page` variable

The `$page` object is probably the variable you will use the most throughout your templates. `$page` always refers to the currently active page.

Like the `$site` variable, the `$page` variable has many methods that allow us to get information from the page. You can find all available methods in the (link: docs/reference text: Reference).

```php
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="description" content="<?= $site->description() ?>">
  <meta name="keywords" content="<?= $site->keywords() ?>">
  <title>
    <?= $page->title()->html() ?> | <?= $site->title()->html() ?>
  </title>
</head>
<body>

  <header>
    <h1>
      <a href="<?= $site->url() ?>">
        <?= $site->title()->html() ?>
      </a>
    </h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <h1><?= $page->title()->html() ?></h1>
    <?= $page->text()->kirbytext() ?>
  </main>

  <footer>
    <p class="copyright"><?= $site->copyright()->html() ?></p>
  </footer>

</body>
</html>
```

The document title and the main container of the page are now completed with data from the currently visited page.

With

```php
<?= $page->title() ?>
```
 we fetch the title of the page and with

```php
<?= $page->text() ?>
```
we get the data from the text field of the page.

<info>
The `html()` (glossary: field-method text: field method) is used to escape content.
</info>

All fields we added to our page content files are now accessible like this.

<info>

Fieldnames are converted to lowercase and any punctuation is replaced with underscores as PHP does not support special characters in method names.

</info>

## A note on reserved words

If you use field names in your text file, which are also used by native Kirby methods, e.g. "image", "videos", "audio", or "num", you cannot fetch the data like described above. To fetch the content of such fields, you have to use the `content()` method:

| Field name      | Variable                     |
| -               | -                            |
| `Image:`        | `$page->content()->image()`  |
| `Videos:`       | `$page->content()->videos()` |
| `Audio:`        | `$page->content()->audio()`  |

## Setting response types

In your templates, you can set different response types depending on content.

For example, to send an `application/json` response:

```php
<?php

$kirby->response()->json();
echo json_encode(['your' => 'data']);
```

You can also send other response types by extension or MIME type:

```php
<?php

$kirby->response()->type('txt');
$kirby->response()->type('text/plain');
```

<info>
The `$kirby->response()` object provides several other methods to customize the response (e.g. caching, HTTP headers and the HTTP status code). (link: docs/reference/objects/cms/responder text: Learn more in the reference ›)
