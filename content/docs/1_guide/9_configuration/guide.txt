Title: Configuration

----

Description: Almost every aspect of Kirby can be controlled and configured to do exactly what you need it to do.

----
Text:

## The `config.php`

General Kirby configuration settings and configuration settings for plugins go into `/site/config/config.php`. The config file contains a return statement with an array of config options:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
<?php

return [
    'debug'  => true,
    'someOtherSetting' => 'something'
];
```

<warning>
Make sure to only use a single return statement in your `config.php` file (with all your options defined in that one return array).
</warning>

<warning>
Since Kirby is not being fully initialized yet when reading the configuration, you cannot use the `$kirby` object or `kirby()` helper in the `config.php`.

If you need to set options dynamically, you can use the (link: docs/reference/system/options/ready text: `ready` option) with a callback.
</warning>

### Plugin options

You can also set options for your installed plugins in the `site/config/config.php`:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
<?php

return [
    'author.pluginname' => [
        'option' => 'a custom value',
        'another-option' => [
            'with-a-nested-option' => 'also a custom value'
        ]
    ]
];
```

<info>
Please use the exact syntax as in the example above, i.e. with the `author.pluginname` as a single string. The following example will ***not* work**:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
<?php

return [
    'author' => [
        'pluginname' => [
            'option' => 'a custom value',
            'another-option' => [
                'with-a-nested-option' => 'also a custom value'
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```
</info>

### Using multiple config files

If you want to keep your `config.php` clean when using more complex options, you can outsource them to individual files that you require in the return array:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'debug' => true,
  'hooks' => require_once 'hooks.php'
];
```

```php "/site/config/hooks.php"
return [
  // your hooks
];
```

## Using options

Config options can be used anywhere in Kirby with the `$kirby->option()` method:

```php
$kirby->option('someOtherSetting');
```

Or with the `option` helper:

```php
  option('someOtherSetting');
```

### Fallbacks

You can pass option fallbacks as second parameter in the option methods. This can be useful if a option does not necessarily have to be set in the config file.

```php
$kirby->option('someOtherSetting', 'my fallback');
option('someOtherOption', 'my fallback');

```

## Hooks and Routes

You can register (link: docs/reference/plugins/extensions/hooks text: hooks) or (link: docs/guide/routing text: routes) in your `config.php` if you don't want to create a plugin for them.

```php "/site/config/config.php"
<?php

return [
  'hooks' => [
    // the hooks definition goes here…
  ],
  'routes' => [
    // the routes definition goes here…
  ]
];
```

## Base URL setup

By default, Kirby detects the base URL of your installation from the server configuration. This base URL is then used to generate all resource URLs and links on your site and in the Panel.

If your URLs are incorrect, this may be because of a reverse proxy that sits in between the client and Kirby. For security reasons, the reverse proxy configuration is only respected if you explicitly configure a fixed base URL or a set of possible base URLs with the `url` option:

```php
<?php

return [
  'url' => [
    'https://example.com',
    'https://staging.example.com',
    'http://example.test'
  ]
];
```

You can read more in the (link: reference/system/options/url text: reference).

## Multi-environment setup

You can set different options based on the domain by adding additional config files containing the domain.

### Example setup

```filesystem
/site/config/config.localhost.php
/site/config/config.staging.yourdomain.com.php
/site/config/config.yourdomain.com.php
/site/config/config.www.yourdomain.com.php
```

By setting different options in those config files, you get a very flexible system that can be deployed to different servers and react to the current environment accordingly.

<info>
Note that the settings in the standard `config.php` file are always used. If you need different settings in another environment, you will have to override those settings in the domain specific configuration file (or only set those options in your domain specific config file).

General settings for all environments should be included in the standard `config.php` file to avoid code duplication. 
</info>

## Custom folder setup

Kirby lets you adjust its default folder setup. Every path to a system-relevant directory is called root in Kirby. All roots can be configured when Kirby is initialized, which normally happens in your `index.php`.

Here is an example in which the site and content folders are renamed.

```php "/index.php"
<?php

include __DIR__ . '/kirby/bootstrap.php';

$kirby = new Kirby([
	'roots' => [
		'index'   => __DIR__,
		'site'    => __DIR__ . '/project',
		'content' => __DIR__ . '/data'
	]
]);

echo $kirby->render();
```

### Public folder setup

In our Starterkit, we offer a flat setup that installs all folders directly in the document root of your server. This is not always the best solution, but it's the solution that is most compatible with all types of hosting.

A typical setup for secure, modern web applications has every private folder behind the document root and the domain points to a public folder with the `index.php` and additional public assets like CSS files, images, etc.

#### index.php

The key to this setup is the `index.php` in the `public` folder:

```php "/public/index.php"
<?php

include __DIR__ . '/../kirby/vendor/autoload.php';

$kirby = new Kirby([
    'roots' => [
        'index'    => __DIR__,
        'base'     => $base    = dirname(__DIR__),
        'content'  => $base . '/content',
        'site'     => $base . '/site',
        'storage'  => $storage = $base . '/storage',
        'accounts' => $storage . '/accounts',
        'cache'    => $storage . '/cache',
        'sessions' => $storage . '/sessions',
    ]
]);

echo $kirby->render();
```

<info>
Note that the path to `/vendor/autoload.php` might vary depending on your setup, for example when you install Kirby with Composer.
</info>

####  Shared storage folder

This example does not only use a public folder setup, it also places accounts, cache and sessions folders in a shared storage folder. This can be a useful pattern to keep track of those additional folders that need to be writable by Kirby.

## Custom URL setup

If you want to serve media and assets from other domains than your main domain, you can define custom URLs for all public facing folders.

This allows you to store your media or assets in other locations on your server or even on a CDN.

Your custom URLs can be configured when Kirby is initialized, which normally happens in your `index.php`. In the example below, custom URLs are set for the `media` and `assets` folders:

```php "/index.php"
<?php

include __DIR__ . '/kirby/bootstrap.php';

$kirby = new Kirby([
	'urls' => [
		'index'  => 'https://getkirby.com',
		'media'  => 'https://media.getkirby.com',
		'assets' => 'https://assets.getkirby.com',
	]
]);

echo $kirby->render();
```

## Panel configuration

The Panel has **(link: docs/reference/system/options/panel text: additional configuration options)** to include custom CSS and JS files, to move it to a different subfolder or to switch it off entirely.
