Title: Panel login

----

Intro: Kirby allows login with email and password and passwordless via a login code or to reset your password. These configurable login methods are different ways of getting into the Panel.

## Available login methods

Kirby comes with three login methods. If you don't configure anything, login via password is the default. Passwordless login needs to be enabled explicitly.

The login methods are defined in the `config.php` file. Learn more in the (link: docs/reference/system/options/auth#login-methods text: reference).

1. **Password (`password`)**
The user gets a login form with email and password fields. It is also possible to combine the password with a second factor or step (for example a code sent via email).

2. **Passwordless login (`code`)**
Here, the login form only has an email field. Instead of logging in with the user's password, the user gets asked for a login code that is sent via email by default or can be generated by plugins. You might know this way of logging in from services like Notion or from our [feedback site](https://feedback.getkirby.com).

3. **Password reset (`password-reset`)**
This method is very similar to the passwordless login, but the purpose is different: After logging in with the code, the user will be redirected to the (link: docs/guide/authentication/password-reset-form text: password reset form). After confirming the new password, the user is redirected to the Panel dashboard.

## Limiting how long a code is valid

You can customize how long generated login/password reset code is valid, see (link:
docs/reference/system/options/auth#authentication-challenges__code-timeout text: Code timeout).

## Password reset

For the password reset feature there is a (link: docs/guide/authentication/password-reset-form text: password reset form)  on its own dedicated page.

## Second factor authentication (2FA)

Kirby supports 2FA via email codes, or one-time time-based codes (TOTP), see (link: docs/guide/authentication/2fa text: second factor authentication)

## Setting the sender and subject for login related emails

You can customize the sender email, sender name and subject of login related emails (login via code, password reset and 2FA via email), see (link: docs/reference/system/options/auth#authentication-challenges__email-options text: Email options).

## Customize email text

When you enable login via code or password reset, Kirby sends an email to the user. You can customize those standard email templates by placing the following email templates into `/site/templates/emails/auth`:

### Login via code

**HTML template:**
`/site/templates/emails/auth/login.html.php`

**Text template:**
`/site/templates/emails/auth/login.php`

**Default email text:**
```php "Subject: Your login code"
Hi <?= $user->nameOrEmail() ?>,

You recently requested a login code for the Kirby Panel.
The following login code will be valid for <?= $timeout ?> minutes:

<?= $code ?>

If you did not request a login code, please ignore this email or contact your administrator if you have questions.
For security, please DO NOT forward this email.
```

### Password reset

**HTML template:**
`/site/templates/emails/auth/password-reset.html.php`

**Text template:**
`/site/templates/emails/auth/password-reset.php`

**Default email text:**
```php "Subject: Your password reset code"
Hi <?= $user->nameOrEmail() ?>,

You recently requested a password reset code for the Kirby Panel.
The following password reset code will be valid for <?= $timeout ?> minutes:

<?= $code ?>

If you did not request a password reset code, please ignore this email or contact your administrator if you have questions.
For security, please DO NOT forward this email.
```

<info>
Our default templates are translated into our Panel languages. Kirby will automatically pick the best language for the email text (the configured user language, the (link: docs/reference/system/options/panel#default-panel-language text: default `panel.language`) or the default site language of a multilang site). The `panel.language` option is also used for the login UI.
