## Naming fields

You can choose the names for your fields freely, but there are two limitations:

1. You can only use **alphanumeric characters** and **underscores** in field names.
2. Do not use names that are **reserved by (link: docs/reference/objects/page text: native page methods)**. For example, if you give your field the name "image", it will conflict with Kirby's `$page->image()` method.

<info>
You can still use field names that conflict with (link: docs/reference/objects/page text: native page methods). But you will have to call such a field via the `$page->content()->image()` method. We recommend prefixing your field names instead.
</info>

## Available fields

(reference: panel/fields)

<info>
If you come from Kirby 2, please note that the title field is automatically added to a page. Please remove all fields called title from your old blueprints.
</info>

## Conditional fields

In all fields, you can set a condition for displaying the field via the `when` option. In the `when` option you define a field name as the key and the required value of that field. In the following example, the text field is only shown when the toggle is set to `true`:

```yaml
fields:
  toggle:
    type: toggle
  text:
    type: text
    when:
      toggle: true
```

If multiple conditions should be fulfilled to show a field, you can add more of them to the `when` option. All of these conditions need to be fulfilled to display the field:

```yaml
fields:
  toggle:
    type: toggle
  category:
    type: select
    options:
      - A
      - B
      - C
  text:
    type: text
    when:
      toggle: true
      category: B
```

<info>
Field names still need to be unique, no matter if they are displayed at the same time or not. Values of undisplayed fields will still be preserved and stored in the content file.
</info>

<info>
Only “and“ conditions are currently possible, so all conditions need to be fulfilled to display the field. For more complicated cases, a (link: https://github.com/rasteiner/k3-whenquery text: third-party plugin) is available.
</info>

## Validating fields

Most fields come with validators you can add as options in your blueprints like `min` and `max` etc., or built-in validators like the `url` field that will automatically check if the given value is a URL. But you can also do more sophisticated validation.

### Pattern matches

With the `pattern` property you can check if the input value matches a given pattern:

```yaml
text:
  type: text
  pattern: '^#([A-Fa-f0-9]{6}|[A-Fa-f0-9]{3})$'
```

### Using validators

You can also use Kirby's (link: docs/reference/system/validators text: built-in validators) or (link: docs/reference/plugins/extensions/validators text: custom validators).

Get a valid IP address:

```yaml
text:
  type: text
  validate:
    ip
```

Accept only alphanumerical values:

```yaml
text:
  type: text
  validate:
    alphanum
```

Make sure the value starts with a given string:

```yaml
text:
  type: text
  validate:
    startsWith:
      AB-
```

## Field shortcuts

For simple fields that are only used **once** per blueprint, you can use a shortcut. Set the field type as key and `true` as the value:

```yaml
fields:
  tags: true
  text: true
```
This code will add a `tags` field and a `text` field with their default properties.

These shortcuts can be extended with a label or other field properties, for example:

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    label: Description
  select:
    options:
      - a
      - b
      - c
```

## Custom fields

You can extend this list with your own field types by creating a (link: docs/reference/plugins/extensions/fields text: field plugin).
