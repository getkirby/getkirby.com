Title: Structuring blueprints
----

Intro: With blueprints you can create highly customized layouts that display the perfect interface for any type of data.

## Columns

(image: columns.png)

A blueprint layout is made up of columns, and each column can hold any number of sections. Kirby ships with the following section types:

(reference: panel/sections)

You can combine those section types in any way you like and also use multiple sections with the same type in a single blueprint layout.

For one page type you might need a list of all subpages, files and a few form elements, whereas for the next page type you just need subpages or a gallery. With sections, all this is possible.

(screencast: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVcg4SlAh-A title: A closer look at pages sections text: Show subpages as cards or list, add additional info for each page, control the card design – there are hardly any limits.)


### Defining columns

Columns can be defined in two ways:

#### Named columns

```yaml
title: My blueprint

columns:
  left:
    width: 2/3
    sections:
      # sections in the left column
  right:
    width: 1/3
    sections:
      # sections in the right column
```

#### Unnamed columns

```yaml
title: My blueprint

columns:
  - width: 2/3
    sections:
      # sections in the left column
  - width: 1/3
    sections:
      # sections in the right column
```

<info>
If you want to extend columns, you have to use named columns.

The following widths are available when defining columns:
`1/2`, `1/3`, `1/4`, `2/3`, `2/4`, `3/4`

### Sticky columns

You can make an entire column sticky. This can be handy for a setup with a smaller sidebar that should always be available, even when you scroll.

```yaml
columns:
  - width: 1/3
    sticky: true
    sections:
      # sections in the sticky column
```


## Adding sections
Once you have set up your base column layout, the fun part begins and you can now add some sections.

```yaml
title: My blueprint

columns:
  # main
  main:
    width: 2/3
    sections:

      # a simple form
      content:
        type: fields
        fields:
          headline:
            label: Headline
            type: text
          text:
            label: Text
            type: textarea

  # sidebar
  sidebar:
    width: 1/3
    sections:

      # a list of subpages
      pages:
        type: pages
        label: Subpages

      # a list of files
      files:
        type: files
        label: Files
```

### Result

(image: columns-screen-1.png)

You can probably already see how flexible this is. By slightly changing the columns, we can change the interface drastically.

### Sidebar on the left

```yaml
title: My blueprint

columns:

  # sidebar
  sidebar:
    width: 1/3
    sections:
      # a list of subpages …
      # a list of files …

  # main
  main:
    width: 2/3
    sections:
      # a simple form …
```
(image: columns-screen-2.png)

### Two Sidebars

```yaml
title: My blueprint

columns:

  # sidebar left
  sidebar_left:
    width: 1/4
    sections:
      # a list of subpages …

  # main
  main:
    width: 2/4
    sections:
      # a simple form …

  # sidebar right
  sidebar_right:
    width: 1/4
    sections:
      # a list of files …
```

## Single-column layouts

(image: sections.png)

If you don't need multiple columns, you can keep your blueprint a lot shorter by using the `sections` option instead of defining columns. This will automatically create a single-column layout for you, where all sections are listed below each other.

```yaml
title: My blueprint

sections:
  drafts:
    type: pages
    label: Drafts
    status: draft
  published:
    type: pages
    label: Published pages
    status: listed
```

## Just some fields

(image: fields.png)

Some blueprint types don't even need sections at all and a simple form is enough. In this case you can make your blueprints even shorter and add the fields definition directly without defining sections or columns.

```yaml
title: My blueprint

fields:
  headline:
    label: Headline
    type: text
  text:
    label: Text
    type: textarea
```

## Adapt all to your needs

(image: columns-complex.png)

Kirby gives you the flexibility to set up the (glossary: Panel), so that it adapts to the needs of every single page/template. Use the layout possibilities to create the structure that works best for you:

```yaml
title: My blueprint

columns:
  gallery:
    width: 1/1
    sections:
      gallery:
        type: files
        layout: card
        ...

  review:
    width: 1/2
    sections:
      drafts:
        type: pages
        status: draft
        ...
      review:
        type: pages
        status: unlisted
        ...

  published:
    width: 1/2
    sections:
      published:
        type: pages
        status: listed
        ...
```


If this isn't yet enough ways and space for you to structure your sections and fields, move on with…

## Tabs


When your blueprints get more complex, splitting up your view into multiple tabs helps to keep them organized. Tabs are basically wrappers around regular blueprint layouts. Check out (link: #columns text: how to create layouts) before you get started with tabs.

(image: tabs.png)

 A tab definition has three options:

- label
- columns
- icon

The icon is optional. Please check out the (link: docs/reference/panel/icons text: list of available icons). You can also use an emoji by pasting it directly into the blueprint.

```yaml
title: My blueprint

tabs:
  content:
    label: Content
    icon: text
    columns:
      # layout
  seo:
    label: SEO
    icon: search
    columns:
      # layout
```

### Full example

```yaml
title: My blueprint

tabs:

  # content tab
  content:
    label: Content
    icon: text
    columns:

      # main
      left:
        width: 2/3
        sections:

          # a simple form
          content:
            type: fields
            fields:
              headline:
                label: Headline
                type: text
              text:
                label: Text
                type: textarea

      # sidebar
      right:
        width: 1/3
        sections:

          # a list of subpages
          pages:
            type: pages
            label: Subpages

          # a list of files
          files:
            type: files
            label: Files

  # seo tab
  seo:
    label: SEO
    icon: search
    fields:
      seoTitle:
        label: SEO Title
        type: text
      seoDescription:
        label: SEO Description
        type: text
```
