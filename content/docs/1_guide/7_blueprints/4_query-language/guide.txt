Title: Query language

----

Intro: Kirby comes with a blueprint query language that offers basically the same functionality as Kirby's PHP API with a simple dot notation.

## Introduction

The query language adds a lot of flexibility when querying options for select, radio  and checkboxes fields, for querying collections in Panel sections and to manipulate how information is displayed in the Panel.

If you are not familiar with (link: docs/guide/templates/php-api text: Kirby's PHP API) yet, you should learn more about it first. The query language is very close to it and will be confusing without the basics.

<info>
In Kirby 5.1 and higher, you can opt-in to using a new (link: docs/reference/system/options/query text: `query.runner`), currently in beta phase, that offers improved performance and (link: #advanced-query-syntax__operators text: additional features).
</info>

### Syntax

#### PHP

```php
$site->title()
$page->title()->lower()
$page->children()
$page->children()->filterBy('featured', true)
$site->find('notes')->children()->filterBy('tags', 'ocean', ',')
$page->images()->template('image')
```

#### Query

```txt
site.title
page.title.lower
page.children
page.children.filterBy("featured", true)
site.find("notes").children.filterBy("tags", "ocean", ",")
page.images.template("image")
```

These are just a few examples. As you can see, it is very close to the PHP syntax. You don't need to relearn anything this way.

<info>
The query language is not limited to built-in methods. You can also use (glossary: model text: page models) and custom methods within your queries.
</info>

### Blueprint example

There are two ways of using the query language in your blueprints:

#### 1. To fetch data

In this example we use the query language to fetch options for a select field. You can fetch any collection of pages, files or users to be used as options.

```yaml
# select field
mySelect:
  label: My Select Box
  type: select
  options:
    type: query
    query: site.children.listed
```

#### 2. To create string templates

Another way to use the language is to create custom information for page or file lists. In this case we use the query language as part of our template syntax.

```yaml
# pages section
published:
  label: Published Pages
  type: pages
  info: "Year: {{ page.year }}"
```

## Querying options in fields

In various field types (tags, select, multiselect, checkboxes, radio, files, pages and related custom fields) you can use the `query` option to query possible options, for example:

```yaml
tags:
    label: Tags
    type: tags
    options:
      type: query
      query: page.siblings
      text: " {{ page.title }}"
      value: "{{ page.uri }}"

mySelect:
  label: My Select Box
  type: select
  options:
    type: query
    query: site.children.listed.template('note') # get all children with the note template

```

Check out the (link: docs/reference/panel/fields text: docs for each of these fields in the Reference).


## Querying the parent in pages and files sections

```yaml
sections:
  articles:
    type: pages
    label: Blog Articles
    parent: site.find("blog")
```

## Querying an image in the image option

```yaml
image:
  query: page.images.template("cover").first
  ratio: 1/1
  cover: true
```

## Querying information to display

```yaml
info: "{{ page.from.toDate('d.m.Y') }} - {{ page.to.toDate('d.m.Y') }} / {{ page.location }}"
```

```yaml
info: "{{ file.dimensions }}"
```

### Escaping HTML
By default, we escape all queries to be displayed against raw HTML output that may lead to XSS attacks. If you include the HTML direcly in the blueprint option, this will still work and display the HTML as intended.

```yaml
info: "<strong>{{ file.dimensions }}</strong>"
```

The query result itself will be escaped though, so if e.g. you would have a custom page method that returns HTML the HTML would be displayed as normal text. If such queries need to return HTML, you can use the `{< >}` syntax. In this case you need to ensure manually that the returned HTML code is safe.

```yaml
info: "{< page.myMethodWithHTML >}"
```


## Advanced query syntax

Queries can include arrays and nested method calls:

```yaml
# arrays
query: site.index.filterBy("template", "in", ["note", "album"])

# nested queries
query: kirby.collection("some-collection").not(kirby.collection("excluded-collection"))
```

If you need to include quotes within strings, you can use the other quote type (`"` vs. `'`) or escape the quotes of the same quote type with backslashes:

```yaml
query: site.title.or("This is a default value with \"quotes\"")
```

Method calls (`parent.method(arguments...)`) are supported if the parent is an object and the method exists (or if the object has a magic `__call()` method) or if the parent is an array and the method is a PHP closure (anonymous function).

Property access (`parent.property`) will behave like this:

- If the parent is an object, Kirby will first try to call a method with that name, then a magic `__call()` method. If neither exist, Kirby will try to access a property with that name or call the magic `__get()` method.
- If the parent is an array, the respective array element will be returned.
- Calling a property without any arguments (`parent.property()`) is equivalent to accessing the property.

<since v="5.1.0">
When you use (link: docs/reference/system/options/query text: the new query runner), queries support subscript access notation, e.g. `page[site.pageMethodName]`.

The new query runner is stricter in parsing queries. In some edge cases, this will require you to access an array/object via subscript notation - in rare cases on the top level via the new `this` keyword, e.g. `this["identifier.with dots and spaces"]`.
</since>

### Operators

You can use optional chaining, the ternary operator (`a ? b : c` or `a ?: c`) and the null coalescing operator (`??`):

```txt
page.cover.toFile?.url
page.title.isNotEmpty ? page.title.lower : page.slug
page.title.value ?? page.slug
```

<since v="5.1.0">
When you use (link: docs/reference/system/options/query text: the new query runner), you can also use
- logical operators: `AND`, `&&`, `OR`, `||`
- comparisons: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
- math operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`

```txt
user.age.toInt > 25 && user.name != "John"
page.price.toFloat + page.vat.toFloat
```

### Arguments in query closures

```php
$query = new Query('(foo) => foo.homer');
$data  = [];

$bar = $query->resolve($data);
$bar = $bar(['homer' => 'simpson']);
$this->assertSame('simpson', $bar);
```
</since>



## Access different data types

mySelect:

    text: "{{ item.value.upper }}"
    value: "{{ item.value.slug }}"
```

mySelect:
  label: My Select Box
  type: select

mySelect:
  label: My Select Box
