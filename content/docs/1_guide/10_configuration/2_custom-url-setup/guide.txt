Title: Custom URL setup

----
Text:

If you want to serve media and assets from other domains than your main domain, you can define custom URLs for all public facing folders.

This allows you to store your media or assets in other locations on your server or even on a CDN.

Your custom URLs can be configured when Kirby is initialized, which normally happens in your `index.php`. In the example below, custom URLs are set for the `media` and `assets` folders:

```php "/index.php"
<?php

include __DIR__ . '/kirby/bootstrap.php';

$kirby = new Kirby([
	'urls' => [
		'index'  => 'https://getkirby.com',
		'media'  => 'https://media.getkirby.com',
		'assets' => 'https://assets.getkirby.com',
	]
]);

echo $kirby->render();
```
