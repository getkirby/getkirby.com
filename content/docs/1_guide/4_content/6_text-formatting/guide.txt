Description: With Kirby's different types of text editing field, it is easy to mark up and style your content in a readable and clean way.

----

Intro: Kirby comes with different text editing fields, that make it easy to edit long form content. From Markdown and Kirbytext to the visual Blocks and Layout field, there is something to suit every editor's needs.

Text:

## Markdown

The following (glossary: Markdown) tags are available to add simple formatting to your text.

(reference: text/markdown)

If you need even more options to format text, like footnotes, tables, definition lists, etc. you can (link: docs/reference/system/options/markdown text: activate Markdown Extra in your config file) to use those additional formats.

## KirbyText

In addition to Markdown, Kirby automatically parses a set of handy tags in your text, whenever you use the (method: $field::kirbytext text: ->kirbytext()) field method to render content in your templates. Those tags make it simple to embed links, images, videos and more.

(reference: text/kirbytags)

### Using KirbyTags in templates

You can even use KirbyTags in your templates with the (helper: kirbytag) helper, for example to embed a video quickly:

```php
<?= kirbytag&lpar;[
  'video'  => 'http://vimeo.com/3432886',
  'width'  => 400,
  'height' => 400
]);
```

### Extending KirbyText

You'd love to have a special tag for embedding pictures from [https://picsum.photos](https://picsum.photos) or you need some other tags for your next client project?

(link: docs/reference/text/kirbytags text: KirbyText is extensible), so you can actually build in all the great features you need.

## Writer field

The (link: docs/reference/panel/fields/writer text: Writer field) type is a simple WYSIWYG editor field for basic nodes like headlines and lists, as well as inline content with formats like bold, italic, etc.

## Blocks & Layout

Blocks are basically like Lego® bricks, but for text and layout. Combine them in whatever way you like to create unique long form content and even complete page layouts without ever leaving the Panel.

While Markdown is great for writing long form text like articles with nothing but a text editor, it doesn't provide a very visual experience, particularly when it comes to integrating rich content elements.

## SmartyPants

(link: https://michelf.ca/projects/php-smartypants/ text: SmartyPants) is a handy little helper to convert typical formatting issues in text into a typographically correct version. This includes quotes, dashes and more.

When you activate SmartyPants in your config, SmartyPants rules are automatically applied whenever you use the (method: $field::kirbytext text: ->kirbytext()) or (method: $field::smartypants text: ->smartypants()) field methods.

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'smartypants' => true
];
```
