You create custom block types from the same three components (blueprint, snippet, option preview) as described in the (link: docs/guide/page-builder/customizing-core-blocks text: previous chapter).

If you don't need a flashy visual preview, you can make do with only a blueprint and a snippet. Learn how to create your own custom block types with our extensive documentation.

## Define custom block in fieldsets

The most simple way to add a custom block is to define it right in the fieldsets list of your blocks field definition. This is great if your custom block is simple and you only need it in this one place.

If your custom block type is more complex or you want to use it in multiple places, it's better to create it in a separate file or even a plugin, but we will get to this later. So let's start simple.

```yaml
fields:
  blocks:
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
      - heading
      - text
      - type: button
        name: Button
        icon: bolt
        fields:
          link:
            type: url
          text:
            type: text
```

In the example above, we mix the default block types (heading and text) with our own custom block type to add a call to action button.

## Block type properties

### Preview

Custom block types don't have a visual preview by default. They show up with the icon and the name from your blueprint definition.

#### Field preview

You can set the preview property to `fields` to allow inline editing of all defined fields without opening the drawer:

```yaml
fields:
  blocks:
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
      - heading
      - text
      - type: button
        name: Button
        preview: fields
        wysiwyg: true
        icon: bolt
        fields:
          link:
            type: url
          text:
            type: text
```

Make sure to also set `wysiwyg: true`, so that the field are editable.

### Label

Custom block types can use the `label` property to show some information from a field in the block. This can be particularly useful for blocks that don't have a preview:

```yaml
fields:
  blocks:
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
      - heading
      - text
      - type: button
        name: Button
        icon: bolt
        label: "{{ text }}"
        fields:
          link:
            type: url
          text:
            type: text
```

(image: block-labels.png)

Within the label property, you have access to an array of field properties, here are some more examples:

```yaml
label: "{{ structure.length }}" # to get the number of items in a structure field

label: "{{ gallery.length }} images" # to get the number of images in a gallery files field

label: "{{ image.0.filename }}" # to get the filename of the first image in the image files field
```
### Editing

To edit a custom block type, editors can either double-tap on the block or click on the edit icon in the toolbar. The block drawer opens with the fields you've defined for the block.

#### Drawer-less blocks

If you don't define any `fields`, the block won't have a drawer. This can be useful for blocks that don't feature any configuration (e.g. the default `line` block).

### Tabs

You can also define tabs for your blocks when they have a lot of settings:

```yaml
fields:
  blocks:
    label: Text
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
      - heading
      - text
      - type: button
        name: Button
        icon: bolt
        tabs:
          content:
            fields:
              link:
                type: url
              text:
                type: text
          styles:
            fields:
              class:
                type: text
              id:
                type: text
```

The tabs will then show up in the block drawer.

## Global block types

For reuse in multiple places, custom block type definitions can be stored in a folder called `site/blueprints/blocks`. In this case we would store it in `/site/blueprints/blocks/button.yml`:

```yaml
# /site/blueprints/blocks/button.yml
name: Button
icon: bolt
tabs:
  content:
    fields:
      link:
        type: url
      text:
        type: text
  styles:
    fields:
      class:
        type: text
      id:
        type: text
```

Now, we can use it in our fieldsets option for any blocks field.

```yaml
fields:
  blocks:
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
      - heading
      - text
      - button
```

This also works in groups:

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
      text:
        label: Text
        type: group
        fieldsets:
          - heading
          - text
          - list
          - button
      media:
        label: Media
        type: group
        fieldsets:
          - image
          - video
      code:
        label: Code
        type: group
        fieldsets:
          - code
          - markdown
```

## Custom block type snippet

To render the HTML for your custom block type in the frontend, create a snippet in `/site/snippets/blocks`. In this case we create a file called `/site/snippets/blocks/button.php`

```php "/site/snippets/blocks/button.php"
<a href="<?= $block->link() ?>" class="btn">
  <?= $block->text() ?>
</a>
```

## Preview plugins

You can turn your custom blocks into highly visual, interactive representations with a custom block preview plugin.
