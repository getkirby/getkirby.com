## Like Lego® bricks for your content

Blocks are basically like Lego® bricks, but for text and layout. Combine them in whatever way you like to create unique long form content and even complete page layouts without ever leaving the Panel.

While (glossary: Markdown) is great for writing long form text like articles with nothing but a text editor, it doesn't provide a very visual experience, particularly when it comes to integrating rich content elements.

This is where Kirby's (link: docs/reference/panel/fields/blocks text: blocks) and (link: docs/reference/panel/fields/layout text: layout) fields shine brightly: Blocks are the perfect solution for complex single-column layouts and long-form text with images, galleries, code, embedded media and more. With the layout field, you take this one step further to arrange blocks in multiple columns to build complex page layouts.

Together, Kirby's blocks and layout fields combine a great WYSIWYG editing experience with fully customizable, flexible blocks. And you can easily extend the default blocks collection with your own or blocks from community plugins. And the best thing is: The HTML output is totally under your control, so it works nicely with your favorite CSS framework, e.g. (link: https://tailwindcss.com/ text: Tailwind CSS) and others.
