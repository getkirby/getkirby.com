## Intro

Using Kirby headless can have many benefits, from security & performance to integrating content into apps and other systems.

This guide will explain how to set Kirby up for headless use on a basic level. This is a pre-cursor guide before you move on to pulling data into another system.

## Prerequisites

- A fresh copy of the Starter Kit installed using Composer. You can find instructions for this in the [Kirby meets Composer](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/install-guide/composer) guide.

- To work locally, you will also need a local web server capable of using SSL such as Laraval Valet or MAMP.

- Make sure to install the [KQL Plugin](https://github.com/getkirby/kql). This gives us a lot of flexibility in fetching data from Kirby.

- If you plan to to run your headless frontend on another origin than your Kirby installation, you may need to configure the (link: docs/reference/system/options/cors text: `cors` option).

## Enabling BasicAuth

With those preliminaries out the way, we can get on with some fun stuff!

The first thing we need to do is enable BasicAuth in the Kirby config.

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
    'api' => [
        'basicAuth' => true
    ]
];
```

This allows use to make authenticated requests in order to retreive data from Kirby. To do so, you will need a user account and a valid password. I prefer to use a dedicated user account for the API. Whilst it is possible to use your own user account credentials, a dedicated account means the API connection won't break if you change or reset your password.

## Testing the connection

We should now be able to make POST requests to the API. I called my local domain `headless.test`. You will need to adjust the following examples to use the local domain you are using.

If you visit `https://headless.test/api/query` in a browser you should get the following response:

```JSON
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Unauthenticated",
  "code": 403,
  "exception": "Kirby\\Exception\\PermissionException",
  "key": "error.permission",
  "file": "authentication.php",
  "line": 14,
  "details": [],
  "route": "query"
}

```

This means the connection is working, however we have not yet authenticated so we are recieving a 403 error. At this point, it is useful to use a tool designed to help test APIs. We will use [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) for the next steps.

Set the user credentials under the Basic dropdown and set the query to POST using the local url to the headless system, for example: `https://headless.test/api/query`

We should now be getting a default response back. We haven't actually made any KQL queries yet, so Kirby will fall back to giving a basic listing of the sites children, as you can see below.

```JSON
{
	"code": 200,
	"result": {
		"children": [
			"photography",
			"notes",
			"about",
			"error",
			"home",
			"sandbox"
		],
		"drafts": [],
		"files": [],
		"title": "Mægazine",
		"url": "https:\/\/headless.test"
	},
	"status": "ok"
}
```

## First KQL query

Let's do something a little more exciting. Under the Query tab in Insomnia, we can add a line of KQL to get all the children of the "Notes" page.

(image: notesInsomnia.png)

The KQL for this is `page('notes').children`, which should yield the following response:

```JSON
{
	"code": 200,
	"result": [
		"notes\/through-the-desert",
		"notes\/chasing-waterfalls",
		"notes\/a-night-in-the-forest",
		"notes\/across-the-ocean",
		"notes\/himalaya-and-back",
		"notes\/exploring-the-universe"
	],
	"status": "ok"
}
```

So far so good. Let's try something a little more complicated. Say for example we want to get all the images from the first child in the photography section. Change the query to the following:

```
page('photography').children.first.images
```

We should now get a list of just those images:

```
{
	"code": 200,
	"result": [
		"photography\/trees\/cheesy-autumn.jpg",
		"photography\/trees\/last-tree-standing.jpg",
		"photography\/trees\/monster-trees-in-the-fog.jpg",
		"photography\/trees\/sharewood-forest.jpg",
		"photography\/trees\/stay-in-the-car.jpg"
	],
	"status": "ok"
}
```

At this point, have some fun trying out a few other queries. You'll find this is quite a powerful way to get data out of Kirby.

## Simple Usage

So far we have only made requests and looked at the kind of responses we can get back. It would be great to use it in a practical example. Let's have a go at getting the data displayed in the browser.

Create a new folder and start a new Conposer project using the following command, and supply the answers required to generate the project:

```bash
composer init
```

Once generated, install [Guzzle](https://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/) via Composer. This package will help us make the connections to the headless Kirby installation from PHP.

```bash
composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle
```

From there create an empty `index.php` in the root of the project. Add the following code to it:



```PHP
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use GuzzleHttp\Client;

$client = new GuzzleHttp\Client();

$api = 'https://headless.test/api/query';

// Create a POST request with Guzzle using KQL
$response = $client->request('POST', $api, [
    'verify' => false,
    'auth' => ['xxx', 'xxx'],
    'json' => [
        'query' => 'page("photography").children',

        'select' => [
            'url' => true,
            'title' => true,
            'text' => 'page.text.markdown',
            'images' => [
                'query' => 'page.images',
                'select' => [
                    'url' => true
                ],
            ],
        ],
    ],

]);

// Handle the incoming data
$body = $response->getBody();
$data = json_decode($body);
$posts = $data->result->data;

// Loop over the result
foreach ($posts as $post) {
    echo '<h1>' . $post->title . '</h1>';
    echo $post->text;
    $images = $post->images;
    foreach ($images as $image) {
        echo  '<img width="150" src="' . $image->url . '"/>';
    }
}
```
Be sure to fill in your credentials in the auth line:

```PHP
'auth' => ['xxx', 'xxx'],
```

You should now be able visit it in a browser after mapping it to a local test domain. It will generate a simple list of the pages and content in the Photography pages, complete with the images that belong to each page.

## Closing

Whilst this simple example isn't terribly pretty, it will hopefully get you started with using Kirby as a headless CMS. Have a go at changing the query to see what else you can display! From here there are quite a lot possibilities. This guide is just the tip of the iceberg and should give you the basis to start exploring.
