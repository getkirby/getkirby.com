If you want to auto-create a given set of subpages every time you create a particular page, you can achieve this with a `page.create:after` hook. To make it more versatile, you can define a custom blueprint setting that leverages Kirby's new `$page->blueprint()` method. We will take you step by step through an example based on the (link: docs/guide/installation#installation text: Starterkit).

Let's say every time you create a new `note` page (in the Panel or programmatically), you want to create two subpages: `gallery` and `info`.

## Blueprint settings

Add the custom option `subpage_builder` to the `note.yml` blueprint in the Starterkit:

```yaml "/site/blueprints/pages/note.yml"
title: Note
num: date
icon: 📖

subpage_builder:
  - title: Gallery
    uid: gallery
    template: gallery
    num: 1
  - title: Info
    uid: info
    num: 2
    template: info

columns:
  - width: 2/3
    fields:
      text:
        type: textarea
        size: large

  - width: 1/3
    sections:
      subpages:
        type: pages
        templates:
          - gallery
          - info
      meta:
        type: fields
        fields:
          date:
            type: date
            time: true
            default: now
          author:
            type: users
          tags: true
          gallery:
            type: pages
            query: site.find("photography").children
            multiple: false
            info: "{{ page.images.count }} image(s)"
            empty: "No gallery selected"
            image:
              cover: true
            help: Place the {{ gallery }} tag anywhere in your text to add the selected gallery

```

As you can see above, we also added a pages section for the subpages.

## The hook
Now we need a (link: docs/reference/plugins/extensions/hooks text: hook) that is called each time a page is created.

We can define it within the `return` array of our `config.php`:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
'hooks' => [
    'page.create:after' => function ($page) {
        buildPageTree($page);
    }
]
```

Within the hook's callback function, we call a function called `buildPageTree()` with the newly created `$page` as first parameter. We will define that function in a plugin.

## The plugin

The `buildPageTree()` function is a recursive function that builds new subpages as long as the blueprint has a subpage builder setting with valid values.

```php "/site/plugins/treebuilder/index.php"
<?php

function buildPageTree($page) {

    // get the subpage_builder definition from the blueprint
    $builder = $page->blueprint()->subpage_builder();

    // if any is set…
    if (empty($builder) === false) {

        // …loop through each page to be built
        foreach($builder as $build) {

            // check if all necessary fields have been defined
            // in subpage_builder
            $missing = A::missing($build, ['title', 'template', 'uid']);

            // if any is missing, skip
            if (empty($missing) === false) {
                continue;
            }

            try {
                // the parent itself is created as a draft
                $subPage = $page->createChild([
                    'content'  => [
                        'title' => $build['title']
                    ],
                    'slug'     => $build['uid'],
                    'template' => $build['template'],
                ]);
            } catch (Exception $error) {
                throw new Exception($error);
            }

            // publish the subpages, so that they are published
            // when the parent is published
            if ($subPage) {

                // call the function recursively
                buildPageTree($subPage);

                // publish subpages and sort
                $subPage->publish();

                if (isset($build['num']) === true) {
                    $subPage->changeSort($build['num']);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, all subpages in the tree are automatically published. That way, they will be published together with the parent without any further interaction.

## Creating subpages if the pages already exists

The workflow we outlined above works with a `page.create:after` hook, so when a new page is created. But what if you want to restructure your site and add those subpages after (some) of the pages already exist.

There are several ways to deal with this:

### Using a `page.update:after` hook

We can call the `buildPageTree()` method in a `page.update:after` hook to create the subpages when a page is updated.


```php "/site/config/config.php"
'hooks' => [
    'page.update:after' => function ($newPage) {
        if ($newPage->children()->isEmpty()) {
          buildPageTree($newPage);
        }
    }
]
```

Depending on whether the page can have other subpages, you might have to adapt the condition.

In many cases, waiting for a page to be updated is not ideal, though.

### Using a `route:after` hook

We can use a `route.after` hook to call the `buildPageTree()` method when a page is visited rather then updated. This is usually more useful, because you would have to visit a page anyway to access the subpages:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
'hooks' => [
    'route:after' => function ($route, $path, $method) {
        $uid = explode('/', $path);
        $uid = end($uid);
        $uid = str_replace('+', '/', $uid);
        $page = kirby()->page($uid);

        if ($page && $page->children()->isEmpty()) {
            buildPageTree($page);
        }
    },
]
```
As before, you might have to adapt the condition.

### Programmatically call the method

In a plugin, or for one time use even in a template, we can call the `buildPageTree()` method on all pages that don't have children yet:

```php
<?php
foreach (page('notes')->childrenAndDrafts()->filterBy('hasChildren', false) as $note) {
    kirby()->impersonate('kirby');
    buildPageTree($note);
}
```

Again, this is only an example and your conditions may be different.
