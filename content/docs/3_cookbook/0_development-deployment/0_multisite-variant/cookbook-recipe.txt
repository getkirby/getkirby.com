In (link: /docs/guide/configuration/multisite-setup text: this recipe) a scenario for running multiple sites via the same Kirby setup has been presented. The proposed setup makes use of the fact that you need only one `/kirby` folder where the heart of Kirby is beating. However, it is also based on the assumption that you have only one virtual (or even real) webserver host from where your various sites will be served. The `index.php` at the root of your installation in this scenario works like a dispatcher and therefore needs some modification.

Even though the proposed setup is easy to accomplish, some might dislike the fact of running multiple websites from one webserver host - amongst others. Instead, you might prefer one virtual host per site, which has the advantage that - from a webserver's perspective - you have clearly seperated installations and configurations for each site. Moreover it provides the ability to extend the capabilities of single hosts while narrowing down others, depending on your needs. Last not least you can enable or disable single hosts without affecting the others.

Hence, here is an alternative approach of a multisite Kirby installation, which provides several additional advantages.

## Preconditions

The following setup was tested on Linux OS (Ubuntu 18.04 and Debian 9) together with Apache HTTP Server 2.4.

## In the filesystem

The proposed filesystem layout in (link: /docs/guide/configuration/multisite-setup text: the above-mentioned recipe) looks like this:

```filesystem
kirby/
my-site.com/
  content/
  media/
  site/
  assets/
my-shop.com/
  content/
  media/
  site/
  assets/
index.php
```
Looking at it from a higher directory level, it could be seen as follows…

```filesystem
/srv/www/
  docroot/
    kirby/
    my-site.com/
      content/
      media/
      site/
      assets/
    my-shop.com/
      content/
      media/
      site/
      assets/
    index.php
```
…where the webserver's virtual or real host's document root points to `docroot`, which could be anywhere in your filesystem.

Let's change that to a setup in which every website is served by a dedicated webserver host. The filesystem would then look like this:

```filesystem
/srv/www/
  my-site.com/
    kirby/
    content/
    media/
    site/
    assets/
    index.php
  my-shop.com/
    kirby/
    content/
    media/
    site/
    assets/
    index.php
```

Fellow Kirby administrators will notice nothing new besides two Kirby installations side-by-side.

However, we can move the `/kirby` folder to a location outside all document roots and replace it with a symbolic link which points to the moved `kirby` folder:

```filesystem
/srv/www/
  kirby/
  my-site.com/
    kirby -> /srv/www/kirby
    content/
    media/
    site/
    assets/
    index.php
  my-shop.com/
    kirby -> /srv/www/kirby
    content/
    media/
    site/
    assets/
    index.php
```

The symbolic links are created like this:

```bash
user@host:/srv/www/my-site.com $ ln -s /srv/www/kirby kirby
user@host:/srv/www/my-shop.com $ ln -s /srv/www/kirby kirby
```

## In `index.php`

PHP can follow the symlinked `/kirby` directory like any other. However, since the root to `index` in `kirby/config/roots.php`  is set up like this…

```php "/kirby/config/roots.php"
...
'index' => function (array $roots) {
  return realpath(__DIR__ . '/../../');
},
...
```

…we need to slightly modify the `index.php` in all of our document roots:

```php "/index.php"
<?php
require 'kirby/bootstrap.php';

$kirby = new Kirby([
  'roots' => [
    'index'   => __DIR__,
  ],
]);

echo $kirby->render();
```
That's it! Now all our Kirby sites will be served from a common `/kirby` folder.

## Further advantages

So far, the new solution provides nothing new compared to the old solution, despite the fact that we are running a webserver host for every Kirby site with all the advantages mentioned above.

What's more, we can now switch between different versions of Kirby with a few keystrokes.

Let's suppose that we want to run `my-site.com` with Kirby 4.0.1, but `my-shop.com` with Kirby 4.1.1. All we need to do is put the `/kirby` folder of every version into a folder of its own, and point the `/kirby` symlinks to the respective folder:

```filesystem
/srv/www/
  kirby-4.0.1/
  kirby-4.1.1/
  my-site.com/
    kirby -> /srv/www/kirby-4.0.1
    content/
    media/
    site/
    assets/
    index.php
  my-shop.com/
    kirby -> /srv/www/kirby-4.1.1
    content/
    media/
    site/
    assets/
    index.php
```

These symbolic links are created like this:

```bash
user@host:/srv/www/my-site.com $ ln -s /srv/www/kirby-4.0.1 kirby
user@host:/srv/www/my-shop.com $ ln -s /srv/www/kirby-4.1.1 kirby
```

Now, when we want to upgrade `my-site.com` from Kirby 4.0.1 to Kirby 4.1.1, all we need to do is to change the symlink in `my-site.com` - actually without even stopping and starting the webserver:

```bash
user@host:/srv/www/my-site.com $ rm kirby
user@host:/srv/www/my-site.com $ ln -s /srv/www/kirby-4.1.1 kirby
```

And we are done!

Want to switch `my-site.com` back to Kirby 4.0.1? You know how easy this is by your own now.

## Licenses for your multi-site

A multi-site always needs a license per domain just like a standard setup. See the (link: license text: Kirby license terms)
