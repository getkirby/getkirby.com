## Introduction

In this guide, we will use (link: https://phpunit.de/ text: PHPUnit) to set up an optimized testing workflow for Kirby plugins with the ability to have custom blueprints and content for each plugin under a single Kirby installation.

## Prerequisites

### PHPUnit

If you don't have PHPUnit, follow the instructions on (link: https://phpunit.de/ text: their site) to install it.

### Kirby

We need a Kirby installation too. It can house all our plugins. Since each plugin will have its own content (although it can use the content of the installation), we will use the (link: https://github.com/getkirby/plainkit text: Plainkit), which is very minimal:

```bash
cd path_to_your_web_root
git clone https://github.com/getkirby/plainkit kirbyplugins
```

## Setup

### Installing a plugin

Create and enter in the plugins folder where Kirby expects plugins:

```bash
cd kirbyplugins/site
mkdir plugins
cd plugins
```

Then, put your plugin there by adding it as a submodule. In this example, we will use the (link: https://github.com/OblikStudio/kirby-link-field text: link-field) plugin:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/OblikStudio/kirby-link-field link-field
```

Let's check if we successfully added the plugin: Open the `site.yml` blueprint and add a new field with type `link`:

```yaml "kirbyplugins/site/blueprints/site.yml"
title: Site
preset: pages
unlisted: true
fields:
  foo:
    type: link
```

When you open the Panel, you should see something like this:

### Bootstrapping Kirby

Open `kirbyplugins/index.php` and you'll see:

```php
require 'kirby/bootstrap.php';

echo (new Kirby)->render();
```

This is the root script that handles every Kirby request. It requires another script, `bootstrap.php`, that loads all Kirby-related stuff and then creates an instance of the Kirby object that is used to render the page.

We need to do the same within our plugin. But we have to provide some configuration to the Kirby object and instead of rendering it, we will run some tests.

#### Folder Structure

In the plugin folder, create the following directory structure:

```filesystem
link-field/
  tests/
    kirby/
    suites/
    bootstrap.php
```

The `kirby` folder will contain the plugin's custom blueprints and content, `suites` will contain our tests, and `bootstrap.php` will be the script that sets up Kirby.

#### The Bootstrap script

Open `bootstrap.php` and add:

```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/../../../../kirby/bootstrap.php';

new Kirby();
echo site()->title();
```

This requires the same script that Kirby normally requires and echoes the site title so we can see if it works. Run the script with the PHP CLI and you should see `Site Title` in the output:

```bash
cd link-field/tests/
php bootstrap.php
Site Title
```

#### Custom Kirby components

Copy the installed `kirbyplugins/content` and `kirbyplugins/site/blueprints` and put them in the plugin's `tests/kirby` folder. You should have a similar directory structure like this:

```filesystem
link-field/
  tests/
    kirby/
      blueprints/
        pages/
        site.yml
      content/
        error/
        home/
        site.txt
    suites/
    bootstrap.php
```

Then, modify the plugin's `bootstrap.php` script so that Kirby is set up to use those folders instead:

```php "link-field/tests/bootstrap.php"
new Kirby([
  'roots' => [
    'content' => __DIR__ . '/kirby/content',
    'blueprints' => __DIR__ . '/kirby/blueprints'
  ]
]);

echo site()->title();
```

To test that, open `tests/kirby/content/site.txt` and change…

```
Title: Site Title
```

…to:

```
Title: Plugin Title
```

Run the `bootstrap.php` script again and you should see the new title:

```
php bootstrap.php
Plugin Title
```

If everything was successful, remove the `echo` line from the `bootstrap.php` script.

## Tests

You should check the (link: https://phpunit.de/getting-started/phpunit-10.html text: PHPUnit documentation) to learn how to write tests. We are going to do the same thing here, basically. Create `tests/suites/PluginTest.php` and put the following inside:

```php
<?php
use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

final class PluginTest extends TestCase {
  public function testTitleValue () {
    $this->assertEquals(site()->title()->value(), 'Plugin Title');
  }
}
```

To run the test, we use the `phpunit` command, supply the plugin's `bootstrap.php` script, and specify the folder containing the tests:

```bash
phpunit --bootstrap ./bootstrap.php --testdox ./suites
```

You should see a similar output:

```
PHPUnit 8.2.3 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.

Plugin
 ✔ Title value

Time: 246 ms, Memory: 10.00 MB

OK (1 test, 1 assertion)
```

All that's left now is adding more tests!

## Extras

### Autoloading

If your plugin uses classes, you would normally (link: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.autoload.php text: autoload) them before running the tests. However, you don't have to in this case because you probably include the classes in your plugin's `index.php` file already. When testing, the plugin's `bootstrap.php` loads Kirby, which loads our plugin, which then loads our classes.

### Composer Scripts

Running the test command manually each time can be tedious. You can take a look at (link: https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/scripts.md text: Composer scripts) and use them instead. To do that, copy the test command to your plugin's Composer configuration and adjust the paths accordingly:

```js "kirbyplugins/site/plugins/link-field/composer.json"
"scripts": {
  "test": "phpunit --bootstrap ./tests/bootstrap.php --testdox ./tests/suites"
}
```

Then, execute `composer run test` in your shell and the tests should run.

### Using the Panel

To be extra fancy, you can use the Panel to edit your plugin's custom content. Open the plugin's `bootstrap.php` script and change it so that the created Kirby object is returned:

```php "link-field/tests/bootstrap.php"
require_once __DIR__ . '/../../../../kirby/bootstrap.php';

return new Kirby([ // <- notice the `return`
  'roots' => [
    'content' => __DIR__ . '/kirby/content',
    'blueprints' => __DIR__ . '/kirby/blueprints'
  ]
]);
```

After that, modify the installation's root `index.php` so that it uses this Kirby object instead:

```php "kirbyplugins/index.php"
require 'kirby/bootstrap.php';

// echo (new Kirby)->render();
echo (require 'site/plugins/link-field/tests/bootstrap.php')->render();
```

You might have noticed that `kirby/bootstrap.php` is required both in `index.php` _and_ in our plugin's `bootstrap.php`. That's OK because our own script uses `require_once` so that the file is included only once.

If you open the Panel, you should see your custom plugin content and be able to edit it. Any changes you make will be saved to the plugin's `content` folder.

### Other custom components

In this guide, we used only custom blueprints and content. However, you can define other custom components for your plugin as well. To do so, change (link: docs/reference/system/roots/ text: the roots) in your plugin's `bootstrap.php` accordingly. This means you can have global setups in your Kirby installation and each plugin can define its own components as needed.
