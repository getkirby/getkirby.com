## Short-form pages in seconds

Creating pages in the Panel usually means: Click the `Add` button above a pages section, fill in a title and optionally customize the slug, land on the draft page, then start editing. That’s perfect for long-form content, but a tad cumbersome for content like:

* Short blog notes
* Status updates
* Bookmarks / link collections
* Event announcements
* Short reviews
* …

For these content types, turn the creation dialog itself into a mini “page factory”.

## Enter the `create` blueprint option

The (link: docs/reference/panel/blueprints/page#page-creation-dialog text: create option) in page blueprints lets you:

- Define additional fields directly in the creation dialog
- Optionally skip adding a title and/or slug
- Skip the redirect after creation
- Automatically publish the page

Here is an example for a `bookmark` type of page as child of a `bookmarks` parent:

```yaml "/site/blueprints/pages/bookmark.yml"
title: Bookmark

create:
  title: "{{ page.date.toDate('Y-m-d }}" # create title from date
  slug: "{{ page.link.slug }}"           # create slug from link
  status: listed                         # publish directly
  redirect: false                        # stay where you are
  fields:
    - date
    - link
    - summary 


fields:
  date:
    type: date
    default: now
    time: true
  link:
    type: url
  summary:
    type: textarea
```

Since the `textarea` field is not supported in the `create` dialog by default, we need to add it to the allowed fields in our main `index.php`

```php "index.php"
<?php

use Kirby\Panel\PageCreateDialog;

require 'kirby/bootstrap.php';

Kirby\Panel\PageCreateDialog::$fieldTypes[] = 'textarea' // textarea field added

echo (new Kirby)->render();
```


Now the `Add` button opens a compact dialog with exactly the fields you need. On submit, the page is created and published, and you can start creating the next page. Pretty fast, isn't it?

## Bonus: Sidebar menu item

To make the experience even faster and smoother, add a (link: docs/reference/system/options/panel/panel-menu text: custom Panel menu) item that opens the creation dialog directly:

In your `config.php`, add:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
<?php
return [
	// …other settings
	'panel' => [
  		'menu' => [
			'site',
			'users',
			// …
			'bookmarks' => [
				'icon'  => 'pen',
				'label' => 'New bookmark',
				'link'  => 'dialogs/pages/create?parent=pages/bookmarks&template=bookmark',
			],
		]
	]
];
```

This gives you a one-click entry point in the sidebar from everywhere without having to navigate the Panel.
