Imagine you are building a new website for your client, but they already have their blog on (link: http://www.tumblr.com/ text: Tumblr) and they use (link: https://www.zendesk.com text: zendesk) to provide support for their world-famous product. Of course, they want to have both a "Blog" and a "Support" link in their main menu and they want to be able to sort the menu items and maybe rename them later. At a later point in time, they might switch from Zendesk to another service, so these links have to be editable.

Redirects are a way to solve this request.

## Manually create folders

To achieve this, we add a folder for each redirect, in this case a `/blog` and a `/support` folder:

```filesystem
content/
	1_about-us/
	2_our-product/
	3_blog/
	4_support/
	5_contact/
```

To list them in the menu, we prepend a number with the position where we want it to appear in the menu.

Inside each folder, we put a `link.txt` content file. You can freely choose the name of this file. Use what works best for you or your client.

The `link.txt` file has just two fields. The title field and a link field:

```kirbycontent
Title: Blog
\----
Link: https://ourawesomeproduct.tumblr.com
\----
```

… and …

```kirbycontent
Title: Support
\----
Link: https://www.zendesk.com/ourawesomeproduct
\----
```
Your clients can change the content later.

## Blueprint for the Panel

To make these pages editable in the Panel, add a `/site/blueprints/pages/link.yml` blueprint with the following content:

```yaml "/site/blueprints/pages/link.yml"
title: Link

fields:
	link:
	  label: Link URL
	  type: url
```
<info>
Make sure to allow creating pages with this blueprint in the `site.yml` blueprint.
</info>

## The template

Now we need a template for that. Add a `link.php` file to your template folder:

```filesystem
	site/
		templates/
			link.php
```

All we want this template to do, is to redirect the visitor to the link from the content file. We can achieve this in just one line of code:

```php "/site/templates/link.php"
<?php go($page->link(), 301) ?>
```

This template doesn't display anything to the visitor but redirects directly to the given link address. The (helper: go) helper function can be used everywhere and does instantly redirect your visitor to the given URL.

Now whenever someone visits `https://yourclientsdomain.com/blog`, they will be redirected to `https://ourawesomeproduct.tumblr.com`. And whenever someone visits `https://yourclientsdomain.com/support`, they will be redirected to `https://zendesk.com/ourawesomeproduct`. The menu is 100% editable from the Panel and you don't need to hack anything. Another side effect is that your client now has those nice branded URLs for their external support platform and blog.

Once you've installed the `link.php` template, you can also use it to create more custom shortened links for your client. By adding invisible folders to the main content folder, you could also create redirects like `http://yourclientsdomain.com/mastodon` or `http://yourclientsdomain.com/someothershortenedlink`


## Route instead of template

Instead of using a template, the same can be achieved with a (glossary: route text: route) instead of a template:

```php "/site/config/config.php"

<?php
return [
    'routes' => [
        [
          'pattern' => '(:any)',
          'action'  => function ($uid) {
            $page = page($uid);

            if ($page?->intendedTemplate() === 'link') {
              return go($page->link(), 301);
            }

            return $page;
          }
        ]
      ]
];
```
