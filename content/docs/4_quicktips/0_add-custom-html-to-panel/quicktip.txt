Summary: Use the (link: docs/reference/panel/fields/info text: info field) in a blueprint to display HTML in the panel.

## Customize the info field

First, use the option `theme: none` in order to disable the info field styling. Second, remove the label from the field with `label: ""`. Now, add your html to the `text` option. You can add multiline HTML content by using the `|` character.

### Blueprint example
```yml
info:
  label: ""
  type: info
  theme: none
  text: |
    <h2>How to install Kirby in 5 minutes</h2>
    <div style="aspect-ratio: 16/9;"><iframe style="object-fit: cover;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EDVYjxWMecc?list=PLTep5U-3mg9EfgnQ08XDRs4vSOmhw2JWz" title="How to install Kirby in 5 minutes" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
```

## More ideas

You could even use the (link: docs/guide/blueprints/query-language text: Kirby Query Language) in order to show dynamic HTML content. For example you could welcome every user with a personal message on the panel dashboard.

### Blueprint example
```yml
info:
  label: ""
  type: info
  theme: none
  text: |
    <h2>Nice to see you, {{ user.name }}</h2>
```

<warning>
Please do not overdo it with custom HTML. You will need to maintain it and maybe customize it if the design of the panel changes. Keep the look of the panel consistent with the rest, and try to use Kirbyâ€™s default HTML and styling whenever possible. Be careful about the kind of HTML you include in the panel to avoid potential security risks.
