## Disabling the render method

`$kirby->render()` can be disabled temporarily by setting

```php
$_ENV['KIRBY_RENDER'] = false;
```

This needs to be set before `$kirby->render()` is called.

As an example, this is used by the (link: https://github.com/getkirby/cli text: Kirby CLI) to load the `index.php` without getting any output. This way, the CLI can access the correct `$kirby` instance with all custom roots and options.

If one of your independent PHP scripts need access to the `$kirby` instance in a similar way, you can require the `index.php` like this â€¦

```php "/example.php"
<?php

$_ENV['KIRBY_RENDER'] = false;

// Kirby will not render anything
require __DIR__ . '/index.php';

// You get full access to the $kirby object
// with all custom settings
dump($kirby);
```
