Intro: A table block based on the structure field

----
Text:

The table block is a rather rudimentary block that is supposed to be fully implemented with a custom block blueprint and snippet.

## Files

### Blueprint

The default blueprint is really just a placeholder and looks like this:

```yaml "/kirby/config/blocks/table/table.yml"
name: Table
icon: menu
preview: table
```

For your custom table block blueprint, create a `table.yml` file in `/site/blueprints/blocks`. The table block is supposed to be used with a structure field called `rows`. As regards the fields inside the structure, you are free to name them whatever you like.

```yaml "/site/blueprints/blocks/table.yml"
name: Simple 3-column menu table
icon: menu
preview: table
fields:
  rows:
    type: structure
    columns:
      dish:
        width: 1/4
      description:
        width: 1/4
      price:
        width: 1/2
        align: right
        after: "USD"
    fields:
      dish:
        type: writer
        marks: false
        inline: true
      description:
        type: text
      price:
        type: number
```

In addition to this basic setup, you can also add additional fields that would allow users to add classes or ids to the block.

### Snippet

The table block doesn’t come with a default snippet, but you have to create it yourself depending on the setup of your table blueprint.

```php "/site/snippets/blocks/table.php"
<?php 
$rows = $block->rows()->toStructure();
if($rows->isNotEmpty()):
?>
<table class="block-table">
  <tr>
    <th>Dish</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Price</th>
  </tr>
  <?php foreach( $rows as $row): ?>
    <tr>
      <td><?= $row->dish()->html() ?></td>
      <td><?= $row->description()->html() ?></td>
      <td><?= number_format ( $row->price()->toFloat(), 2 , null, '.' ) ?></td>
    </tr>
  <?php endforeach ?>
</table>
<?php endif; ?>
```

If you don’t like the default preview, you can of course (link: docs/reference/panel/fields/blocks#preview-plugins text: create your own preview as well).
