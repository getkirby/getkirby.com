## Example

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    label: Writer
    type: writer
```

## Field properties

(field-options: writer)

## Inline mode

By default, the writer field will supports multiple paragraphs (`<p>`). In inline mode, hitting enter will create breaks instead of creating a new paragraph.

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    type: writer
    inline: true
```

## Choosing available marks

The writer field supports the following marks by default:

- `bold`
- `italic`
- `underline`
- `strike`
- `code`
- `link`
- `email` (since v3.6.0)

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    type: writer
    inline: true
    marks:
        - bold
        - italic
        - strike
```

## Format/node options

<since v="3.6.0">
Apart from paragraph nodes, the writer field supports headings and lists. You can fine-tune the writer field from your blueprint by defining the availabel block formats (nodes).

Unsupported formats will automatically be ignored when content is pasted and the toolbar will also not include the matching buttons.

```yaml
fields:
  writer:
    type: writer
    nodes:
      - heading
      - bulletList
      - orderedList
```

## How to use in templates/snippets

The content of the writer field is stored as plain HTML. To render the field in your template, echo the value.

```php
<?= $page->text() ?>
```
