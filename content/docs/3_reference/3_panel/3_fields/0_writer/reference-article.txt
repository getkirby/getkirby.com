#### Example

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    label: Writer
    type: writer
```

## Field properties

(field-options: writer)

## Marks

The writer field supports the following marks by default:

- `bold`
- `italic`
- `underline`
- `strike`
- `code`
- `link`
- `email`

<since v="4.0.0">
- `sub`
- `sup`
- `clear`
</since>

The special mark `|` can be used to separate marks in the toolbar by a vertical line.

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    type: writer
    inline: true
    marks:
      - bold
      - italic
      - '|'
      - strike
```

## Nodes

Apart from paragraph nodes, the writer field supports headings and lists. You can fine-tune the writer field from your blueprint by defining the available block formats (nodes).

The writer field supports the following marks by default:

- `paragraph`
- `bulletList`
- `orderedList`
- `heading`
- `horizontalRule`

<since v="4.0.0">
- `quote`
</since>

Unsupported formats will automatically be ignored when content is pasted and the toolbar will also not include the matching buttons.

```yaml
fields:
  writer:
    type: writer
    nodes:
      - heading
      - bulletList
      - orderedList
```

## Toolbar

The `toolbar` option allows you to customize the writer's toolbar:

```yaml
text:
  type: writer
  marks:
    - bold
    - italic
    - link
    - code
  toolbar:
    inline: false
    marks:
      - bold
      - "|"
      - link
```

- `inline` attaches the toolbar to the top of the field (instead of the floating pill style)
- `marks` and `nodes` control which marks and nodes are shown in the toolbar. Make sure that the ones you want to include are actually active and not excluded in the top-level `marks` and `nodes` options (see above). The top-level options define which ones are supported, the toolbar-level options what is shown as buttons in the toolbar. For example, you might want to support the code mark for pasting, but hide it from the toolbar.
</since>

## Inline mode

By default, the writer field will supports multiple paragraphs (`<p>`). In inline mode, hitting enter will create breaks instead of creating a new paragraph.

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    type: writer
    inline: true
```

In `inline` mode, all nodes (see above) are disabled.

<since v="4.0.0">
## Heading levels

You can set the available heading levels in the writer field with the `headings` option:

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    type: writer
    headings:
      - 2
      - 3
      - 4
```
</since>

## How to use in templates/snippets

The content of the writer field is stored as plain HTML. To render the field in your template, echo the value.

```php
<?= $page->text() ?>
```
