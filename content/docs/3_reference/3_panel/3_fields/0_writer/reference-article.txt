## Example

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    label: Writer
    type: writer
```

## Field properties

(field-options: writer)

## Inline mode

By default, the writer field will supports multiple paragraphs (`<p>`). In inline mode, hitting enter will create breaks instead of creating a new paragraph.

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    type: writer
    inline: true
```

## Choosing available marks

The writer field supports the following marks by default:

- `bold`
- `italic`
- `underline`
- `strike`
- `code`
- `link`

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    type: writer
    inline: true
    marks:
        - bold
        - italic
        - strike
```

## How to use in templates/snippets

The content of the writer field is stored as plain HTML. To render the field in your template, echo the value.

```php
<?= $page->text() ?>
```
