Title: Slug

----

Intro:

A phone number input field

----

Guide: blueprints/fields

----

Text:

The slug field creates a text input that automatically sanitizes the typed value with our built-in sluggify method. It's perfect if you want to create IDs or class names for HTML elements or paths for files or URLs.

## Example

```yaml
fields:
  className:
    label: Class
    type: slug
```

## Field properties

(field-options: slug)

## How to use in templates/snippets

```php
<div class="<?= $page->className() ?>">
  <!-- -->
</div>
```

## Sync option

You can sync the slug field with another field. Whenever the editor types something into the synced field, the slug field will update with a sluggified version of the input:

```yaml
fields:
  className:
    label: Class Name
    type: slug
    sync: title
```

## Allow option

By default, the slug field will strip out or replace any non-alphabetic, non-numeric character with a simple dash. You can define additional allowed characters with the allow option:

```yaml
fields:
  className:
    label: Class Name
    type: slug
    sync: title
    allow: _
```
