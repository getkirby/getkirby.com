Title: Calendar
----
Text:

The Calendar component is mainly used for our `DateInput` component, but it could be used as stand-alone calendar as well with a little CSS love.

```html
<k-calendar value="2012-12-12" @input="selectDate" />
```

## Props

### value / v-model

`String (default: null)`

ISO date string. I.e. `2012-12-12`

## Events

### input

The input event is fired when a date is selected. The date is passed as ISO date string.

## CSS Class

`.k-calendar`
