## Events

You can bind any native event to the image. Additionally the image component will fire a `load` or `error` event, once the image has been loaded or failed to load.

```html
<k-image
  ratio="1/1"
  src="myimage.jpg"
  :crop="true"
  @load="yayLoaded"
  @error="ohNo"
  @click="clicked"
/>
```
