Title: User methods

----

Text:

User methods are registered with the `userMethods` extension.

## Default user methods

**For a full (link: docs/reference/#user text: list of default user methods), please check out the Reference.**

<info>Be aware that you cannot override these default user methods with any custom user method. If you want to override default methods, you can use a (link: docs/reference/plugins/extensions/user-models text: user model) instead.</info>

## Getting started

You can extend the set of defined user methods in a plugin file.

```php "/site/plugins/user-methods/index.php"
Kirby::plugin('my/plugin', [
    'userMethods' => [
        'fullname' => function () {
            // provided there are firstname and lastname fields in the user blueprints
            return $this->firstname() . ' ' . $this->lastname();
        }
    ]
]);
```

This example shows the basic architecture of a user method. You define the method name with the key for the `userMethods` extension array. `$this` in the callback function refers to the `$user` object.

## Working with method arguments

In some cases it might be helpful to be able to pass arguments to the method:

You can define arguments for a method like this:

```php "/site/plugins/user-methods/index.php"
Kirby::plugin('my/plugin', [
    'userMethods' => [
        'greetUser' => function ($text = 'Hello') {
            return $text . ', ' . $this->username();
        }
    ]
]);
```

And then use it like this:

```php
<?= $user->greetUser('Dear') ?>
```
