Text:

Page models are registered with the `PageModels` extension.

Page models extend Kirby's default page object. Methods that you define in a page model are available everywhere in Kirby where you call a page of the extended type.


```php "/site/plugins/page-models/index.php"
class BlogPage extends Page
{
	// your custom page methods
}

Kirby::plugin('my/pageModels', [
	'pageModels' => [
		'blog' => 'BlogPage'
	]
]);
```

For details see (link:docs/guide/templates/page-models text:  page models in the guide).
