Title: Request auth types

----

Text:

Request auth types are used to parse the authentication information in the `Authorization` header of the HTTP request. They are called by the `$request->auth()` method internally.

You can create your own custom auth types by extending one of the existing types or the base `Auth` class.

## Extending an existing auth type

If your auth type shares some of its logic with an existing type, you can extend the class of that type:

```php "/site/plugins/your-plugin/index.php"
class CustomTokenAuth extends Kirby\Http\Request\Auth\BearerAuth
{
    // implement methods here
}
```

You then have to register the new auth type with its name. For example for the `Authorization: Custom-Token ...` header:

```php
Kirby\Http\Request::$authTypes['custom-token'] = CustomTokenAuth::class;
```

## Extending the `Auth` class

Alternatively, you can extend the `Auth` class to implement a new auth type.

```php "/site/plugins/your-plugin/index.php"
class DigestAuth extends Kirby\Http\Request\Auth
{
    // implement methods here
}
```

As before, you have to register the new auth type:

```php
Kirby\Http\Request::$authTypes['digest'] = DigestAuth::class;
```
