Intro: Options for the Panel

----

Text:

## Disabling the Panel

If you don't need the Panel at all and you just want to work in your content folder, you can switch the Panel off in your config file.

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'panel' => false
];
```

## Allow the Panel to be installed on a remote server

As a security measure, you cannot install the Panel on a public server by default. To allow this, you can enable the `panel.install` option:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'panel' =>[
    'install' => true
  ]
];
```

It's recommended to remove this setting after the installation on your remote server is complete.


## Moving the Panel to a different URL

If you want to add a little bit of additional security to your site and hide the Panel behind a different URL, you can set the URL slug in your config.

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'panel' => [
    'slug' => 'super-secret-admin-area'
  ]
];
```

Your Panel is now accessible at http://yourdomain.com/super-secret-admin-area


## Custom Panel CSS

We have made the design of the Panel as usable, beautiful and reduced as possible so that you or your clients can fully concentrate on creating content. However, if you want to spice it up a little or adjust to your or your clients branding, you can do that with your own custom stylesheet file. Add it to your `config.php` file like this:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'panel' => [
    'css' => 'assets/css/custom-panel.css'
  ]
];
```

## Custom Panel JS

You can also add your own custom Panel scripts in the config.php, giving you even more power to bend the Panel to your liking.

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'panel' => [
    'js' => 'assets/js/panel.js'
  ]
];
```

## Custom Panel Favicon

To offer a full white-label solution for your customers, you can even set a custom favicon for the Panel.

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'panel' => [
    'favicon' => 'assets/favicon.ico'
  ]
];
```
</since>

## Default Panel language

You can set the default Panel language that is used before a user logs in or when the user does not have a valid language configured:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'panel' => [
    'language' => 'de'
  ]
];
```

<since v="3.5.1">
If the Panel language is not configured, Kirby will default to English on single-language sites and the default content language on multi-language sites.
</since>

## KirbyText/Markdown

If false, the Panel formatting buttons and drag and drop for files and links will create regular (glossary: Markdown) instead of (glossary: kirbytag text: KirbyTags).

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'panel' => [
    'kirbytext' => false
  ]
];
```

### Drag texts

<since v="3.4.3">
You can define custom callback functions (`pageDragText` or `fileDragText`) for the text that gets inserted when dragging a page or a file on a textarea, e.g.

```php
return [
  'panel' => [
        'kirbytext' => [
            'fileDragText' => function(\Kirby\Cms\File $file, $url) {
                if($file->extension() === 'jpg') {
                    return sprintf('(\screenshot: %s)', $url);
                }

                if($file->type() === 'video') {
                    return sprintf('(\video: %s loop: true)', $url);
                }

                return null;
            },
            'pageDragText' => function (\Kirby\Cms\Page $page) {
                return sprintf('Check out this great page: %s', $page->url());
            },

        ],
    ],
];
```
</since>
