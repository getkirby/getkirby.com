Intro: Set language for slug generator

## Set language for slug generator

You can set a language for Kirby's slug generator, so that it uses the language specific settings:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'slugs' => 'de'
];

```

Alternatively, you can define custom rules:

```php  "/site/config/config.php"
Str::$language = [
  'ÃŸ' => 'sz'
];
```

These custom rules have to be stored in a (link: docs/guide/plugins/plugin-basics text: plugin). Custom rules overwrite the `slugs` option.

## Set allowed max length of slugs

You can set a maximum length for page slugs:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'slugs.maxlength' => 120
];
```
