Intro: Custom fatal view that is shown if there's a PHP error

----

Text:

The fatal option takes a closure as value.

```php
return [
  'fatal' => function($kirby, $exception) {
    include $kirby->root('templates') . '/fatal.php';
  }
];
```

<since v="3.5.5">
The `$exception` argument was added in Kirby 3.5.5.
