This is a walkthrough on how to install and use Tailwind CSS with Kirby.


## Preparation
Before we start, you need to install Node.js for the build process on your client machine (or on the machine where you want to use Tailwind CSS). The latest version, which also includes npm (Node package management) can be downloaded from the (link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ text: official Node.js website). You can test successful installation by opening a terminal window and typing the following two commands:

```bash
node --version
```
```bash
npm --version
```

We use a Kirby (link: try text: Starterkit or Plainkit) to get started, and create a new `/src` folder in the project's root, so that our folder structure looks like this.



```filesystem
.htaccess
composer.json
content/
index.php
kirby/
media/
README.md
site/
src/
```

## Configuration
Also in the projects's root, we create a `package.json` file which controls the build process. This file contains two build scripts, one for development (*watch*) and one for live mode (*build*).

```js "/package.json"
{
    "name": "projectname",
	"scripts": {
		"watch": "npx tailwindcss -i ./src/css/tailwind.css -o ./assets/css/styles.css --jit --purge './site/**/*.php' -w",
        "build": "npx tailwindcss -i ./src/css/tailwind.css -o ./assets/css/styles.css --jit --purge './site/**/*.php' -m"
	}
}
```


### Explanation
Use `watch` to observe changes and generate a CSS file on change
Use `build` to generate a final minified CSS file

- `-i ./src/css/tailwind.css`: input file with Tailwind's css classes
- `-o ../assets/css/styles.css`: output file which will be generated
- `--jit`: Tailwinds just in time engine *(still preview, but highly recommend!)*
- `--purge '../site/**/*.php'`: folder to watch for Tailwind's classes
- `-w`: defines watch mode
- `-m`: minify output file



## CSS Styles

After creating the build configuration, we create a subfolder `/css` in the `/src` folder and inside that folder a file called `tailwind.css`. Inside that file we use the `@tailwind` directive to inject Tailwindâ€™s `base`, `components`, and `utilities` styles.
```css "/src/css/tailwind.css"
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Our `/src` folder should look like follows and we are ready to install Tailwind CSS.
```filesystem
src/
  css/
  tailwind.css
```


## Install Tailwind CSS
Open the terminal window again (and leave it open), change to the project folder and type the following command:
```bash
npm install tailwindcss@latest
```
By executing the command above a `node_modules` folder with the required dependencies and the file `package-lock.json` will be automatically created in the project root.



## Config Tailwind CSS (optional)
If you want to customize your Tailwind installation, you can create an additional config file `tailwind.config.js` in the project root. This file will then be automatically processed at build time if it exists.


```js "/tailwind.config.js"
module.exports = {
  darkMode: false,
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
```
<info>More details on how to customize Tailwind CSS can be found on the (link: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration text: in the Tailwind CSS docs).</info>


## Build
Now we have a fully functional basic setup and are ready to generate our CSS file. Make sure you are in the project root folder and start the `watch` or the `build` script as follows:

Use `watch` to observe changes and generate a CSS file on every change:
```bash
npm run watch
```

Use `build` to generate a final minified CSS file:
```bash
npm run build
```

Both scripts scan all php files inside the `/site` folder for Tailwind CSS classes and write them to the CSS file `styles.css`.

<info>
If it doesn't exist, the `/assets/` folder structure will be created by the script automatically.
</info>

All that's left to do is link to this file in your HTML `head` tag:

```php
<?= css('assets/css/styles.css') ?>
```
