Text:
This is an advanced version of the cookbook recipe for nested blocks, which additionally allows to pass collected values from the parent block to the nested block. You should have read and understood the cookbook recipe [Nested blocks](../panel/nested-blocks) first. In this example we extend it with additional layouts.


## Preparation
You need to install the [Nested blocks](../panel/nested-blocks) example from the mentioned cookbook recipe above. We modify this example step by step.


## Blueprints

First let's change the blueprints with the new requirements. We add a select field `layout` to our FAQ block and offer two layout variants for it.

```yaml "/site/plugins/faq-block/blueprints/blocks/faq.yml"
name: FAQ
icon: star
fields:
  layout:
    type: select
    empty: false
    options:
      v1: Layout 1
      v2: Layout 2
  headline:
    type: text
  text:
    type: writer
  blocks:
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
      - faqItem
```

## Output

Now we modify the output snippets with our new requirements.

### FAQ snippet
We can deliver different HTML code depending on which version we are in by checking the `layout` value.

```php
$layout = $block->layout()->value();

if ($layout == 'v1'):

  // HTML code for layout version 1

elseif ($layout == 'v2'):

  // HTML code for layout version 2

endif;
```
Within each version, we now call the nested block as follows. It is important to pass the selected `layout` to the nested block, if we want to use different HTML markup for each version.

```php
foreach ($block->blocks()->toBlocks() as $nestedBlock):

  snippet('blocks/' . $nestedBlock->type(),[
    'block' => $nestedBlock,
    'layout' => $layout
  ]);

endforeach;
```




### Question/answer snippet

By passing the layout value from the parent block, we can use it via `$data['layout']` in the nested blocks now. We just need to check the value and can deliver different HTML output for each version.

```php "/site/plugins/faq-block/snippets/blocks/faqItem.php"
if ($data['layout'] == 'v1'):

  // Nested HTML code for layout version 1

elseif ($data['layout'] == 'v2'):

  // Nested HTML code for layout version 2

endif;
```
