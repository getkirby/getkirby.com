Title: My first Panel view

----

Text:

For our very first Panel view, we will query a public API and display the results in a nice card layout.

<info>
For the purposes of this recipe, we assume you have read the (link: docs/guide/plugins/plugin-setup-panel text: Panel plugin setup guide) on how to get started with our Panel plugin bundler (link: https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirbyup text: kirbyup).

You can install the (link: https://github.com/getkirby/pluginkit/tree/4-panel text: Pluginkit) as a basis or create the file structure we need manually, that's up to you. Also, it doesn't matter if you use the Plainkit or the Starterkit as a starting point.
</info>

Let's start by creating a new folder in the plugins folder, which we will call `moviereviews`. Inside this folder, we first create a `package.json` file with the contents copied from the Pluginkit example mentioned above.

```js "/site/plugins/moviereviews/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "npx -y kirbyup src/index.js --watch",
    "build": "npx -y kirbyup src/index.js"
  }
}
```

This will take care of compiling our source files into an `index.js` file in the root of our `moviereviews` plugin folder.

## Custom API route

Inside the `moviereviews` folder, we create an `index.php` with the Kirby plugin wrapper. And inside this wrapper, we create a custom API route that serves as our data provider. It requests the data from the selected API with a `Remote::get()` request and returns it, so that we can later use it in our component.

For this example, we reuse the (link: https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/movie-reviews-api/1/overview text: NYT Movie Reviews API) we already used in the (link: docs/guide/virtual-pages/content-from-api text: Virtual Pages guide). To follow this example, create an account and an example app (link: https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started text: by following their instructions). Then get your API key and add it to the code below.

```php
<?php

Kirby::plugin('getkirby/moviereviews', [
    'api' => [
        'routes' => [
            [
                'pattern' => 'moviereviews',
                'action'  => function () {
                    $reviews = [];
                    $apikey  = 'your api key here';
                    $request = Remote::get('https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/picks.json?api-key=' . $apikey);
                    if ($request->code() === 200) {
                      $reviews = $request->json(false)->results;
                    }
                    return $reviews;
                }
            ]
        ]
    ]
]);
```

You can test if the route returns the desired data by opening the API URL in your browser. Make sure to login to the panel first and set a custom CSRF token for the API in your config.

<info>
The custom CSRF should only be set for debugging and removed afterwards unless it is required for the specific use-case.
</info>

```php "/site/config/config.php"

return [
    'api' => [
        'csrf' => 'test',
    ]
];
```

You can now access the following API URL by using the temporary CSRF. The `pretty` option helps to render the JSON output in a human-readable way.

```
http://localhost/api/moviereviews?csrf=test&pretty=true
```

This will give you a nice overview of the data structure.

## Create the view component

Next, we create a new folder called `/src` inside our `moviereviews` folder. Inside the `src` folder, we create an `index.js` file.

```js "/site/plugins/moviereviews/src/index.js"
import View from "./components/View.vue";

panel.plugin("getkirby/moviereviews", {
  views: {
    moviereviews: {
      component: View,
      icon: "video",
      label: "Movie reviews"
    }
  }
});
```

Inside this file, we register the new custom `moviereviews` view component called `View`. The view itself will be defined in the `components` subfolder and called `View.vue`.

Inside `View.vue`, we reuse the Kirby `k-view` and `k-header` components for our basic view setup.

```html "/site/plugins/moviereviews/src/components/View.vue"
<template>
  <k-view class="k-moviereviews-view">
    <k-header>Movie reviews</k-header>
  </k-view>
</template>

<script>
export default {

};
</script>
```

## Compile and check

Now let's run

```
npm run dev
```

in our plugin folder, and kirbyup will compile an `index.js` in the `moviereviews` folder.

If all went well, we will now see a new menu entry in the Panel dropdown navigation, and when we click on it, we can visit the newly created view that's still empty at this time.

## A component for our data

But how do we get our data in? To achieve this, we create a new Vue component, let's call it `reviews`. This new component will show each data item from our data provider in a cards layout, another component Kirby provides for us. We also add an empty (link: docs/reference/plugins/ui/card text: `k-card` component).

```html "/site/plugins/moviereviews/components/Reviews.vue"
<template>
  <div class="k-reviews">
    <k-cards data-size="medium">
      <k-card />
    </k-cards>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {

}
</script>
```

## Register the new component

When we visit our Panel view, nothing has changed yet. That's because we haven't registered the new component yet. Let's do that now.

In our `View` component, we do three things:

1. We import the `Reviews.vue" component
2. In our `export` object, we register the component
3. We add the new `<reviews/>` component to the template below the header


```html "/site/plugins/moviereviews/components/View.vue"
<template>
  <k-view class="k-moviereview-view">
    <k-header>Moview reviews</k-header>
    <reviews />
  </k-view>
</template>

<script>
import Reviews from "./Reviews.vue";

export default {
    components: {
        Reviews
    }
};
</script>
```

If we now return to the Panel, our view has changed and will show the cards component with a single empty card in it.

## Connecting the data

We are almost there. Here is the final `Reviews.vue` component which we will explain in more detail in a minute.

```html "/site/plugins/moviereviews/src/components/Reviews.vue"
<template>
  <div class="k-reviews">
    <k-cards data-size="medium">
      <k-card
        v-for="review in reviews"
        :key="review.display_title"
        :link="review.link.url"
        :info="review.byline"
        :text="review.summary_short"
        :image="{
          ratio: '3/2',
          cover: true,
          back: 'pattern',
          url: review.multimedia.src
        }"
        target="_blank"
      />
    </k-cards>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      reviews: [],
    };
  },
  created() {
    this.load();
  },
  methods: {
    load() {
      this.$api
        .get("moviereviews")
        .then(reviews => {
          this.reviews = reviews;
        });
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

Let's first look at the script part:

```html
<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      reviews: [],
    };
  },
  created() {
    this.load();
  },
  methods: {
    load() {
      this.$api
        .get("moviereviews")
        .then(reviews => {
          this.reviews = reviews;
        });
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

Within the `export` object, we have to define the data our component returns as a function.

```js
data() {
  return {
    reviews: [],
  };
},
```

Once the Vue component is created, we call the `load()` method.

```js
created() {
  this.load();
},
```

The `load()` method calls the `moviereviews` route from the API, and then assigns the result to `this.reviews`.

```js
methods: {
  load() {
    this.$api
      .get("moviereviews")
      .then(reviews => {
        this.reviews = reviews;
    });
  }
}
```

We can now loop through the data and create a card for each review:

```html
<k-cards data-size="medium">
  <k-card
    v-for="review in reviews"
    :key="review.display_title"
    :link="review.link.url"
    :info="review.byline"
    :text="review.summary_short"
    :image="{
      ratio: '3/2',
      cover: true,
      back: 'pattern',
      url: review.multimedia.src
    }"
    target="_blank"
  />
</k-cards>
```

Here we fill the props of the (link: docs/reference/plugins/ui/card text: card component) with life. We loop through each review (`v-for="review in reviews"`) and assign the data items to the `info`, `text` and `image` props. We also add a `link` to the original review.

## Building your plugin

Once you are happy with your plugin, you can create minified and optimized versions of the `index.js` and `index.css` with …

```
npm run build
```

## Final folder structure

```filesystem
moviereviews/
  index.js
  package.json
  src/
    index.js
    components/
      View.vue
      Reviews.vue
```

## Where to go from here

To get more familiar with how this all plays together, play around a bit. Try to get other data in, from a database, a .csv file, another API or try to fetch some data from your Kirby installation. Adjust the data provider route as needed. Change the layout to a table. Try to add events…
