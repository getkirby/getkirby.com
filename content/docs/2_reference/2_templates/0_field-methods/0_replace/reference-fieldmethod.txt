Example text:

```text
Text: The company behind {{ product }} and the responsible data controller for this website is the {{ company }}.
```

<?= $page->text()->replace(
    [
        'company' => 'Content Folder GmbH & Co. KG',
        'product' => 'Kirby CMS'
    ]
);
```

Will result in

```
The company behind Kirby CMS and the responsible data controller for this website is the Content Folder GmbH & Co. KG.
