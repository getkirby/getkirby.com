## Details

For validators, see (link: docs/reference/system/validators text: list of available validators). In addition, you can use (link: docs/reference/plugins/extensions/validators text: custom validators).

Examples:

```php
<?php if ($page->email()->isValid('email')): ?>
The email address in the email field seems to be valid
<?php endif ?>
```

Some validators require additional arguments:

```php
<?php if ($page->title()->isValid('maxLength', 45)): ?>
The text length is valid
<?php endif ?>
```

```php
<?php if ($page->number()->isValid('between', 5, 10)): ?>
The number is between 5 and 10
<?php endif ?>
```
