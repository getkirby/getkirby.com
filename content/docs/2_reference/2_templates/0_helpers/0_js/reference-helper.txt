Examples:

### Creating a single script tag

```php
<?= js('assets/js/site.js') ?>
```

### Creating multiple script tags

```php
<?= js([
  'assets/js/jquery.js',
  'assets/js/jquery.ui.js',
  'assets/js/site.js',
]) ?>
```

### Autoloading template specific script files

```php
<?= js('@auto') ?>
```

Template specific JS files must be located in `/assets/js/templates` and named like the template.

Template                    | JS file
-                           | -
/site/templates/project.php | /assets/js/templates/project.js
/site/templates/home.php    | /assets/js/templates/home.js
/site/templates/blog.php    | /assets/js/templates/blog.js

### Async

If you want the JS files to be loaded asynchronously (if supported by the browser), you can set a second parameter to `true`:

```php
<?= js('assets/js/site.js', true) ?>
```

This also works with an array of paths:

```php
<?= js([
  'assets/js/jquery.js',
  'assets/js/jquery.ui.js',
  'assets/js/site.js',
], true) ?>
```

### Other attributes

You can also pass an array of completely custom attributes like the `defer` attribute:

```php
<?= js('assets/js/site.js', ['async' => true, 'defer' => true, 'data-something' => 'my-value']) ?>
```
