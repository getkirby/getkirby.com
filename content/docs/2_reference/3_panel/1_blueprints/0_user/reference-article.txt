Title: User blueprint

----

Intro: User blueprints are located in `/site/blueprints/users` and control the Panel setup, form fields and permissions for a user role.

Text:

## Blueprint location

```filesystem
/site/blueprints/users/
```

## Default user blueprint

To create the same set of fields for all roles, you can setup a `default.yml` that is used whenever no custom role blueprint is configured.

```filesystem
/site/blueprints/users/default.yml
```

## Title and description

The title is required and will appear in the list of selectable roles when a new user is created. An optional description can be displayed as well:

```yaml
title: Client
description: The client can edit all pages
```

### Translated titles

Title and description can be translated by passing an array of translations with the matching language code as key:

```yaml
title:
  en: Client
  de: Kunde
description:
  en: The client can edit all pages
  de: Der Kunde kann alle Seiten bearbeiten
```

## Home option

When a user logs in to the Panel, they normally get redirected to the last view they were on before they were logged out or the Site view. When you work with permissions, you might want to block the Site view or redirect the user to a completely different view instead. This is now possible with the new `home` option for user blueprints. This way you can define the redirect for each role individually. Redirects can be simple paths or dynamic locations via string queries.


### Simple paths

```yaml "/site/blueprints/users/editor.yml"
title: Editor
home: /panel/account
```

### Queries to panel views

```yaml "/site/blueprints/users/editor.yml"
title: Editor
home: "{{ site.find('blog').children.first.panel.url }}"
```

### Queries to pages

```yaml "/site/blueprints/users/editor.yml"
title: Editor
home: "{{ site.find('blog').children.first.url }}"
```


## Image options

The image options for users can now be defined directly in their own blueprint. This significantly simplifies the setup of sections as they all inherit the image settings. You can still set image settings in sections the good old way if needed.

```yaml "site/blueprints/user/editor.yml"
image:
  back: blue-200
  icon: 📝
```

### Support for queries

Panel preview image options now all support our powerful queries:

```yaml "site/blueprints/users/editor.yml"
image:
  back: "{{ user.myCustomBackColor }}"
```

### Custom colors
`back` and `color` options for Panel preview images now support shorthands for core CSS color variables as well as HEX codes or other native CSS color properties (e.g. even gradients):

#### CSS color property shorthands

```yaml
image:
  back: "purple-400"
```
Check out the (link: https://lab.getkirby.com/public/lab/basics/design/colors text: list of our color properties) for available options.

#### Hex codes

```yaml
image:
  back: "#ff0000"
```

#### CSS rules

```yaml
image:
  back: "linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(2,0,36,1) 0%, rgba(9,9,121,1) 35%, rgba(0,212,255,1) 100%);"
```

## Permissions

The `permissions` option can be used to restrict access to certain actions for the particular role. By default, all actions are allowed and you can deny them by passing `false`.

### `access`

| Option | Value |
|----    | ---- |
| `account` | `true`/`false` |
| `panel` | `true`/`false` |
| `users` | `true`/`false`|
| `site` | `true`/`false` |
| `system`| `true`/`false` |
| `languages` | `true`/`false` |

#### Example: Prevent accessing user management and settings

```yaml
permissions:
  access:
    settings: false
    users: false
```


### `files`

| Option | Value |
|----    | ---- |
| `changeName` | `true`/`false` |
| `create` | `true`/`false` |
| `delete` | `true`/`false` |
| `replace` | `true`/`false` |
| `sort` | `true`/`false` |
| `update` | `true`/`false` |

#### Example: Prevent deleting files

```yaml
permissions:
  files:
    delete: false
```

### `pages`

| Option | Value |
|----    | ---- |
| `changeSlug` | `true`/`false` |
| `changeStatus` | `true`/`false` |
| `changeTemplate` | `true`/`false` |
| `changeTitle` | `true`/`false` |
| `create` | `true`/`false` |
| `delete` | `true`/`false` |
| `duplicate` | `true`/`false` |
| `move` | `true`/`false` |
| `preview` | `true`/`false` |
| `read` | `true`/`false` |
| `sort` | `true`/`false` |
| `update` | `true`/`false` |

#### Example: Prevent deleting and creating pages and changing their template

```yaml
permissions:
  pages:
    delete: false
    create: false
    changeTemplate: false
```

### `site`

| Option | Value |
|----    | ---- |
| `update` | `true`/`false` |

### `users`

The `users` setting can be set generally to `false` to prevent the user from editing, adding or deleting other users.

```yaml
users: false
```

It is also possible to set the `users` options individually.



| Option | Value |
|----    | ---- |
| `changeEmail` | `true`/`false` |
| `changeLanguage` | `true`/`false` |
| `changeName` | `true`/`false` |
| `changePassword` | `true`/`false` |
| `create` | `true`/`false` |
| `delete` | `true`/`false` |
| `update` | `true`/`false` |

#### Example:

```yaml
permissions:
  access:
    users: true
  users:
    delete: false
    create: false
    changeRole: false
```

### `user`

This option refers to each user with this role.

| Option | Value |
|----    | ---- |
| `changeEmail` | `true`/`false` |
| `changeLanguage` | `true`/`false` |
| `changeName` | `true`/`false` |
| `changePassword` | `true`/`false` |
| `changeRole` | `true`/`false` |
| `create` | `true`/`false` |
| `delete` | `true`/`false` |
| `update` | `true`/`false` |


#### Example

This user can access the user management, but not edit other users. The user cannot change their own role or delete themselves.

```yaml
permissions:
  access:
    users: true
  users: false
  user:
    delete: false
    changeRole: false
```

### Using wildcards
It's also possible to restrict access to entire blocks by just passing `false` to the block:

```yaml
permissions:
  pages: false
```
