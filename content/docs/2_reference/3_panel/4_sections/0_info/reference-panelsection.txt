Title: Info section

----

Intro:

Add help text and info boxes to the Panel to help your editors

----

Text:

The info section is perfect for any kind of static text that you want to place in a (glossary: Panel) layout. It can be used for general info, help, warnings and other guides for your editors.

## Example

```yaml
title: Gallery

sections:
  info:
    type: info
    label: Info
    text: |
      Please double-check the licenses and sources
      of all images before you upload them to the gallery.
```

### Using KirbyText

In addition to markdown, you can use KirbyText in your info text, even including images:

```yaml
info:
  text: |
    Check out the &lpar;link: help text: help pages) for details
```

## Section shortcuts

For simple sections that are only used once per blueprint, you can use shortcuts. In its most basic form, an `info` section consists of the section type as name, and the `text` property with the information you want to show.

```yaml
sections:
  info:
    text: Some text
```

Keep in mind that the same section name can only be used once per blueprint.


## Info section vs. info field

The info section behaves pretty much like the (link: docs/reference/panel/fields/info text: info field). Why do we have both of them? Because both are useful. The info field can be placed in a field grid and is perfect to offer help within a form. The info section can be placed anywhere else, especially in layouts that don't need form fields.

## Section properties

(section-options: info)

## Label

The label will be displayed above the info section. You can pass a simple headline as a string or you can provide translations for multiple languages, if you have an international editing team.

### Single language

```yaml
label: This is some very important information
```

### Multiple languages
```yaml
headline:
  en: Attention
  de: Achtung
  es: Attencion
```

### Placeholders

You can inject information from the current page into the headline with template placeholders using our (link: docs/guide/blueprints/query-language text: query language).

```yaml
label: "{{ page.title }} Information"
```

## Text

The text can be a simple string, Markdown, KirbyText or HTML. Just like the headline, the text can also be translated. You can also use Kirby's query language to query text from some field or show some other information.

### Single language
```yaml
text: Info
```

### Multiple languages
```yaml
text:
  en: This is some very important information
  de: Das ist eine wichtige Mitteilung
```

### Multi-line text

If you want to write multi-line text with paragraphs, you have to use a special YAML syntax for it.

```yaml
text: |
  Dear Edith,

  this is some multi line text with paragraphs.

  Cheers,
  A. Dmin
```
### Text queries

```yaml
text: "{{ kirby.page('somepage').text()->kt() }}"
text: "{{ site.index.count }}"
text: "{{ site.index.images.count }}"
```

## Themes

By default, the info section is displayed as a blue info box. You can switch the theme with the `theme` option, to match the importance or meaning of the information.

The following themes are available:

- `info` (default)
- `positive`
- `negative`
- `notice`
- `warning`
- `passive`
- `text`
- `dark`
- `code`
- `empty`

### info

```yaml
title: Gallery

sections:
  info:
    type: info
    label: Info
    theme: info
    text: |
      Please double-check the licenses and sources
      of all images before you upload them to the gallery.
```

### negative

(image: info-section-negative.png)

```yaml
title: Gallery

sections:
  info:
    type: info
    label: Attention
    theme: negative
    text: |
      Please double-check the licenses and sources
      of all images before you upload them to the gallery.
```

### positive

(image: info-section-positive.png)

```yaml
title: Gallery

sections:
  info:
    type: info
    label: Wohooww
    theme: positive
    text: |
      Just upload whatever you want. We get sued anyway.
```

### Disable theming

You can disable the infobox theme entirely to show neutral text.

```yaml
fields:
  info:
    type: info
    label: Info
    theme: none
    text: |
      This is a very neutral message
```
