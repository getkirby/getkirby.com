## Basic setup

A basic blueprint with a files preset creates an empty files upload section:

```yaml
Title: Files preset example
preset: files
```

### Empty
(image: files-empty.png)

### Filled
(image: files-filled.png)

This basic blueprint can be extended in many ways.

## Options

### Label

```yaml
title: Gallery section
preset: files
label: Image gallery
```

### Template

You can set the `template` option to filter files and define the template that is assigned to each uploaded file.

```yaml
title: Gallery section
preset: files
template: image
```

### Layout

Like in any other files section, you can choose between `list` and `card` layout:


```yaml
title: Gallery section
preset: files
layout: cards
```

### Image

```yaml
title: Gallery section
preset: files
layout: cards
image:
  cover: true
  ratio: 1/1
  back: black
```

## Usage in tabs

<info>
All presets can also be used within tabs as the following example shows.
