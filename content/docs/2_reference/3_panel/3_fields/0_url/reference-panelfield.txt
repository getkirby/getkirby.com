Text:

The url field is a standard text field with the type `url` and a custom URL icon. It comes with built-in validation for URLs.

<info>
The URL validation may lead to incorrect results (= a valid URL being marked as invalid or the other way around) in rare edge-cases. In those edge-cases you can manually input the URL into the content text files or switch to a simple text field.
</info>

## Example

```yaml
fields:
  url:
    label: URL
    type: url
```

## Field properties

(field-options: url)

## How to use in templates/snippets

Output the field value as simple string:

```php
<?= $page->url() ?>
```


Convert to `a` tag:

```php
<?= $page->url()->toLink() ?>
```

See the docs for the [`toLink()`](/docs/reference/templates/field-methods/to-link) method for further options.
