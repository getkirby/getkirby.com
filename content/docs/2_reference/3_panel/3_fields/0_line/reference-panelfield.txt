Title: Line

----

Intro:

Draws a horizontal line to separate fields

----

Text:

Sometimes it can be helpful to visually seperate the form into different sections. The line field is perfect here. It will draw a horizontal rule with enough white space around it to separate sets of fields nicely.

## Example

```yaml
fields:
  line:
    type: line
```

If you want to add multiple lines to your form, make sure that the names for each field are unique:

```yaml
fields:

  …

  lineA:
    type: line

  …

  lineB:
    type: line

  …

  lineC:
    type: line
```
