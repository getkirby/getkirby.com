Text:

The entries field allows you to create and manage multiple entries for the same field. It offers editors a flexible alternative to the (link: /docs/reference/panel/fields/structure text: structure field) for when they need to handle a list of content that only consists of one field.

## Usage

```yaml
entries:
  type: entries
  min: 2
  max: 4
  required: true
  field:
    type: select
    options:
      design: Design
      architecture: Architecture
      photography: Photography
      3d: 3D

### In templates/snippets

To easily loop through your entries and retrieve each entry as field object, you can use the new `$field->toEntries()` method:

```php
<ul>
  <?php foreach ($page->entries()->toEntries() as $entry): ?>
    <li><?= $entry->upper() ?></li>
  <?php endforeach ?>
</ul>
```
