Title: Object

----

Intro:

Structured object input, which stores properties as YAML.

----

Text:

The object field allows to create data objects. This is handy for more complex settings, isolated entities or nested data.

A typical example would be contact data for an author in a blog article, multiple layout settings for images in your template, custom settings for a theme, SEO configuration etc.

## Example

```yaml
fields:
  contact:
    type: object
    fields:
      photo:
        type: files
      name:
        type: text
      email:
        type: email
      phone:
        type: tel
```

Such an object will be stored in the content file like this:

```yaml
contact:
  photo:
    - file://hb38HvnQfm8HlQ6e
  name: Nandi Peters
  email: nandi@example.com
  phone: 1234 5678
```

If you need to store a list of multiple objects, take a look at the (link: docs/reference/panel/fields/structure text: structure field).

## Field properties

(field-options: object)

## Fields

You can define any number of fields and use the same (link: docs/reference/panel/fields text: field types listed):

(reference: panel/fields)

<info>
Each field value is stored like in a normal Kirby content file. This means that all field types are supported, however all of their values are converted to strings. For most fields there is no difference, but structured fields will *not* be nested inside the same YAML data structure. This ensures broad compatibility.
</info>

## Default values

You can set default values for an object field which will prepopulate the field when a new page is created.

```yaml
fields:
  contact:
    type: object
    default:
      name: Nandi Peters
      email: nandi@example.com
      phone: 1234 5678
    fields:
      photo:
        type: files
      name:
        type: text
      email:
        type: email
      phone:
        type: tel
```

## How to use in templates/snippets

To access a object field in your templates, you can use the [`toObject()`](/docs/reference/templates/field-methods/to-object) method.

Let's say we wanted to render the `contact` data from above in a template:

```php
<?php if ($contact = $page->contact()->toObject()): ?>
<dl>
  <dt>Photo</dt>
  <dd><?= $contact->photo()?->toFile()->crop(200) ?></dd>
  <dt>Name</dt>
  <dd><?= $contact->name() ?></dd>
  <dt>Email</dt>
  <dd><?= $contact->email() ?></dd>
  <dt>Phone</dt>
  <dd><?= $contact->phone() ?></dd>
</dl>
<?php endif ?>
```

<info>
If you nest object fields inside another object field, block field or structure field, you have to call the `toObject()` method on the nested fields as well and then access the nested object properties like above.
