The headline field helps to group larger sets of fields. It creates a headline with additional white-space and a prepended index number.

## Example

```yaml
fields:
  pageSettings:
    label: Page Settings
    type: headline
  type:
    label: Page type
    type: text
  state:
    label: Draft
    type: toggle
  content:
    label: Content
    type: headline
  text:
    label: Text
    type: textarea
```

## Field properties

(field-options: headline)

## Hiding the headline numbers

```yaml
fields:
  pageSettings:
    label: Page Settings
    type: headline
    numbered: false
  type:
    label: Page type
    type: text
  state:
    label: Draft
    type: toggle
  content:
    label: Content
    type: headline
    numbered: false
  text:
    label: Text
    type: textarea
```

You can also just hide the numbers of one or a few headlines on a page, those headlines are then skipped when counting through. The others will get numbers like normal.
