Title: Textarea

----

Intro:

Guide: blueprints/fields

Text:

The textarea field creates a textarea for longer texts with automatic resizing and optional format buttons.

## Example

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    label: Text
    type: textarea
```

## Field properties

(field-options: textarea)

## Sizes

In some section layouts, a small textarea looks lost. The `size` option sets an initial default height for empty textareas before auto-sizing kicks in. Available sizes:

- `small`
- `medium`
- `large`
- `huge`

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    label: Text
    type: textarea
    size: large
```

## Toolbar

### Disabling the toolbar

If the formatting toolbar should not be available, you can switch it off entirely:

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    label: Text
    type: textarea
    buttons: false
```

### Customizing the toolbar

You can also specify which buttons to show in the toolbar.

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    label: Text
    type: textarea
    buttons:
      - bold
      - '|'
      - link
      - email
```

You can add your (link: docs/reference/plugins/extensions/textarea-buttons text: custom textarea buttons) in a plugin.

## File upload and select

The file upload and select button is super useful if you want to embed images or other files right in your text.

You can define the button behavior with the `files` and `uploads` options:

```yaml
textarea:
  type: textarea
  files: page.images
  uploads: textarea-upload
```

By default all files will be uploaded to the current page and without a predefined template. With the additional options you can fetch files from anywhere and upload them to specific pages. You can also control which file template should be assigned by default:

```yaml
textarea:
  type: textarea
  files:
    query: site.find("media").files.template("textarea-upload")
    image:
      cover: true
  uploads:
    parent: site.find("media")
    template: textarea-upload
```

You can also deactivate file uploads:

```yaml
textarea:
  type: textarea
  uploads: false
```

## Monospace

You can set the `font` option to `monospace`, for example for fields that contain code:

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    label: Text
    type: textarea
    font: monospace
```


## How to use in templates/snippets

The usual way to render the value of a textarea field is using the `kirbytext()` method (or the shortcut `kt()`).

```php
<?= $page->text()->kirbytext() ?>
<?= $page->text()->kt() ?>
```

However, there might be situations, where you want to parse KirbyTags, but not render block level elements:

```php
<p><?= $page->text()->kt()->inline() ?></p>
```
