Title: Hidden

----

Intro:

Creates a hidden field

----

Text:

The hidden field allows storing values in the content file that are not visible to users in the Panel. This can be useful to store additional information for a page, which is only available to the developer or editors who have access to the filesystem. Such a `hidden` field can be edited only either directly in the filesystem or programmatically via a script.

## Example

```yaml
fields:
  title:
    label: Title
    type: title
  text:
    label: Text
    type: textarea
  notes:
    type: hidden
```
