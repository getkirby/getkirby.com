## Enable multi-lang feature in the Panel

To allow users to define and switch languages from the Panel, you have to enable the feature: 

```php
return [
    'languages' => true
];
```

## Automatic language detection

Kirby can detect the preferred language of the visitor. This has to be enabled in your config:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
    'languages' => [
        'detect' => true
  ]
]
```

<warning>
Using the [root URL for the default language](#language-specific-urls) will disable automatic language detection.

By default, users can add and edit language variables via the Panel. To prevent this, you can disable this feature:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
    'languages' => [
        'variables' => false
    ]
]
```
