## Update check for Kirby

Kirby's update check suggests both security updates and feature updates by default.

### Security-only mode

In security-only mode, Kirby will only suggest the minimum possible security update. If your installed version is not affected by known vulnerabilities, no updates will be suggested:

```php
<?php

return [
    'updates' => [
        'kirby' => 'security'
    ]
];
```

### Disabled checks

You can also disable the update checks for Kirby entirely:

```php
<?php

return [
    'updates' => [
        'kirby' => false
    ]
];
```

<warning>
Note that Kirby will no longer display security warnings in this mode. If you disable the update check, we strongly recommend to keep an eye on the news in (link: https://chat.getkirby.com/ text: Discord) or on (link: https://mastodon.social/@getkirby text: our fediverse account) to keep your installation secure.
</warning>

## Update check for plugins

All installed plugins are checked for updates by default.

### Configuration for all plugins

You can disable the update check for all plugins like this:

```php
<?php

return [
    'updates' => [
        'plugins' => false
    ]
];
```

### Configuration by plugin

You can also customize the behavior for each plugin using wildcards. This is useful if you use custom or private plugins that are not published on the Kirby website:

```php
<?php

return [
    'updates' => [
        'plugins' => [
            'yourcustom/plugin' => false,
            'another-vendor/*'  => false
        ]
    ]
];
```

Any plugin that isn't matched by the configured list will have its update checks enabled. If you want to default to a disabled update check, you can configure the option like this:

```php
<?php

return [
    'updates' => [
        'plugins' => [
            '*'           => false,
            'some/plugin' => true,
            'vendor/*'    => true
        ]
    ]
];
```

## Disable all update checks

You can disable any kind of update or security check for both Kirby and plugins like this:

```php
<?php

return [
    'updates' => false
];
```

If you want to keep the security checks for Kirby but disable update checks for plugins, use:

```php
<?php

return [
    'updates' => 'security'
];
```

## Custom update check endpoint

The update and security checks request their raw data from our CDN at `https://assets.getkirby.com`.

If you want to use your own proxy or custom update check endpoint, you can override that base URL:

```php
<?php

Kirby\Cms\System\UpdateStatus::$host = 'https://your-url.com';

return [
    // ...
];
```
