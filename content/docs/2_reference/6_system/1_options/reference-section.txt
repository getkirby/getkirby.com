Intro:

Kirby comes with sensible default settings, but you can use its config options to change Kirby's behavior and functionality according to your preferences. You can even set environment specific options by providing additonal, domain-specific config files.

In addition to the config options listed below you can define your own config settings for use in plugins, templates etc.

Text:


Config options can be set in your config file or in a plugin.

<warning>
Make sure to only use a single return statement in your `config.php` file (with all your options defined in that one return array.
</warning>
