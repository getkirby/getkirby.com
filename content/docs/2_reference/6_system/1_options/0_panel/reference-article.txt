Intro: Options for the Panel

----

Text:

## Disabling the Panel

If you don't need the Panel at all and you just want to work in your content folder, you can switch the Panel off in your config file.

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'panel' => false
];
```

## Allow the Panel to be installed on a remote server

As a security measure, you cannot install the Panel on a public server by default. To allow this, you can enable the `panel.install` option:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'panel' =>[
    'install' => true
  ]
];
```

It's recommended to remove this setting after the installation on your remote server is complete.

## Move the Panel to a different URL

If you want to add a little bit of additional security to your site and hide the Panel behind a different URL, you can set the URL slug in your config.

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'panel' => [
    'slug' => 'super-secret-admin-area'
  ]
];
```

Your Panel is now accessible at http://yourdomain.com/super-secret-admin-area

## Panel menu

You can customize what entries the Panel menu is showing and even add your own. Learn about (link: docs/reference/system/options/panel/panel-menu text: all the options to customize the Panel menu).

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'panel' => [
    'menu' => [
      'site' => [
        'label' => 'Overview'
      ],
      'notes' => [
        'icon'  => 'pen',
        'label' => 'Notes',
        'link'  => 'pages/notes'
      ],
      '-',
      'users'
    ]
  ]
];
```

## Panel search

You can customise both the default search type selected when opening the Panel search dialog as well as how many result items should be shown at once:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'panel' => [
    'search' => [
			'type'  => 'files'
			'limit' => 5
		]
  ]
];
```
## Default Panel language

You can set the default Panel language that is used before a user logs in or when the user does not have a valid language configured:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'panel' => [
    'language' => 'de'
  ]
];
```

If the Panel language is not configured, Kirby will default to English on single-language sites and the default content language on multi-language sites.

## KirbyText/Markdown

If false, the Panel formatting buttons and drag and drop for files and links will create regular (glossary: Markdown) instead of (glossary: kirbytag text: KirbyTags).

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'panel' => [
    'kirbytext' => false
  ]
];
```

## Custom Panel CSS

We have made the design of the Panel as usable, beautiful and reduced as possible so that you or your clients can fully concentrate on creating content. However, if you want to spice it up a little or adjust to your or your clients branding, you can do that with your own custom stylesheet file. Add it to your `config.php` file like this:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'panel' => [
    'css' => 'assets/css/custom-panel.css'
  ]
];
```

<info>
If you have multiple environments like staging, production etc., you can use different stylesheets per environment (link: docs/guide/configuration#multi-environment-setup text: in your domain-specific config files). Shared styles can be imported into each domain-specific stylesheet with an import statement:

```css
@import url("custom.css");
```
</info>

More information:

- (link: docs/reference/panel/styling text: Styling the Panel)
- (link: https://lab.getkirby.com/public/lab/basics/design/colors text: All CSS properties)
- (link: docs/quicktips/customizing-panel text: Examples for customizing the Panel)

Instead of adding it to your `config.php`, CSS to be applied globally in the Panel can also be added via a plugin: if an `index.css` file is present in the root folder of a plugin, it will be automatically loaded into the Panel.

## Custom Panel JS

You can also add your own custom Panel scripts in the config.php, giving you even more power to bend the Panel to your liking.

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'panel' => [
    'js' => 'assets/js/panel.js'
  ]
];
```

## Custom Panel Favicon

To offer a full white-label solution for your customers, you can even set a custom favicon for the Panel. From a simple implementation…

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'panel' => [
    'favicon' => 'assets/favicon.ico'
  ]
];
```

…to full control over all formats:


```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'panel' => [
    'favicon' => [
      'apple-touch-icon' => [
        'type' => 'image/png',
        'url'  =>  'assets/apple-touch-icon.png',
      ],
      'shortcut icon' => [
        'type' => 'image/svg+xml',
        'url'  => 'assets/favicon.svg',
      ],
      'alternate icon' => [
        'type' => 'image/png',
        'url'  => 'assets/favicon.png',
      ]
    ]
  ]
];
```

### Drag texts

You can define custom callback functions (`pageDragText` or `fileDragText`) for the text that gets inserted when dragging a page or a file on a textarea, e.g.

```php
return [
  'panel' => [
    'kirbytext' => [
      'fileDragText' => function(\Kirby\Cms\File $file, $url) {
        if ($file->extension() === 'jpg') {
          return sprintf('(\screenshot: %s)', $url);
        }

        if ($file->type() === 'video') {
          return sprintf('(\video: %s loop: true)', $url);
        }

        return null;
      },
      'pageDragText' => function (\Kirby\Cms\Page $page) {
        return sprintf('Check out this great page: %s', $page->url());
      },
    ],
  ],
];
```

## Allow frame embedding

The Panel sets the `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'` header by default. This protects against clickjacking attacks by preventing embedding in frames on other pages.

If you need to embed the Panel into another page or site, you can customize this header:

```php
return [
  'panel' => [
    // allow frame embedding from the same domain
    'frameAncestors' => true,

    // allow frame embedding from the same *and* from the specified domains
    'frameAncestors' => ['*.example.com', 'https://example.com'],

    // allow frame embedding on any domain (not recommended)
    'frameAncestors' => '*',
  ]
];
```

<warning>
Only allow embedding if you fully control the domains you allowlisted. Otherwise your site may be vulnerable against clickjacking attacks. Read more at [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Clickjacking).
</warning>

<since v="4.7">
## Disable the Vue template compiler

We are in the active process of migrating the Kirby Panel to Vue 3 (with the plan to ship Vue 3 in Kirby 6.0). Until this process is complete, sites with increased security requirements should use the Vue 2 runtime version, which omits the vulnerable Vue template compiler.

In its default configuration, Kirby enables the template compiler, as it is needed for all Panel plugins that have not been precompiled. It is also used for the examples in the Panel lab environment.

Kirby 4.7 introduces a new `panel.vue.compiler` option that can be set to `false` to disable the template compiler and switch to the Vue 2 runtime version. We recommend to set this option to `false` if your site and the installed plugins do not rely on the Vue template compiler. Should you require the template compiler and are not affected by its [known vulnerabilities](https://www.herodevs.com/vulnerability-directory?framework=Vue+2), you can set the option to `true` to make the warning in the Panel go away. Do this at your own risk!

```php
return [
  'panel' => [
    'vue' => [
      'compiler' => false
    ]
  ]
];
```
</since>
