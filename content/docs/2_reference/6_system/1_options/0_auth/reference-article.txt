Intro: Set options for login via the Panel and the API

## Brute-force protection

The following options configure how fast Kirby's (link: docs/guide/security#use-good-passwords text: login brute-force protection) gets activated and how long it takes until the triggered protection is disabled again.

### Number of trials

You can set the number of wrong trials and login challenges (e.g. password reset, two-factor auth) per timeout period (see below) before login gets blocked for the current IP address and user. The default setting is 10.

```php
return [
  'auth' => [
    'trials' => 10
  ]
];
```

### Timeout

You can also set the timeout in seconds for the period of time against which the number of trials is counted. The default is 3600 (one hour). After the timeout is over, login for the current IP address and user is possible again.

```php
return [
  'auth' => [
    'timeout' => 3600
  ]
];
```

## Login methods

The `auth.methods` option controls the available login methods for the Panel and the API.

The available options are:

| Name | Explanation |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `password` | Login with email and password (default) |
| `code` | Passwordless login with just the email address and a code |
| `password-reset` | Password reset via a code |

You can read more about the options in the (link: docs/guide/authentication/login-methods#available-methods text: guide). The options can be combined like in the following examples.

<info>
All login methods except the default `password` method need a working email transport configuration. Otherwise verification emails cannot be sent. Find out more about **(link: /docs/reference/system/options/email#email-transport text: how to configure your email transport)**.
</info>

### Login via code

If you want to prevent login via password completely, you can set the login methods option to `code`. The default login via password will be disabled.

```php "/site/config/config.php"
<?php

return [
    'auth' => [
        'methods' => 'code'
    ]
];
```

### Login via code & login via password

You can also combine login via code and login via password. The `password-reset` method is then no longer available.

**The first method in the array will be the default login method.**

```php "/site/config/config.php"
<?php

return [
    'auth' => [
        'methods' => ['code', 'password']
    ]
];
```

### Password reset

To enable the password reset form, you can combine the default `password` login method with the `password-reset` method:

```php "/site/config/config.php"
<?php

return [
    'auth' => [
        'methods' => ['password', 'password-reset']
    ]
];
```

### Two-step or two-factor authentication

To enable two-step/two-factor authentication for your logins, you can pass the `2fa` option to the `password` method in an array.

The default `2fa` mode will ask users for their email and password first and then send a verification email with an additional code that they have to enter afterwards to verify their login.

This is a two-step authentication as it relies on the password to the email account being secure. If you want even more security, you can use (link: docs/reference/plugins/extensions/auth-challenges text: auth challenge plugins) for challenges like TOTP, SMS or hardware tokens. The login flow is the same, but the additional login code then gets verified by the plugin.

Two-factor/two-step authentication is *not* compatible with the `code` or `password-reset` options as logging in via just a code would circumvent the added `2fa` security.

```php
<?php

return [
    'auth' => [
        'methods' => [
            'password' => ['2fa' => true]
        ]
    ]
];
```

## Authentication challenges

Once the user requests a login code or a password reset code, an authentication challenge is created. Kirby by default ships with an email challenge where the code is sent via email. Additional challenges can be added by (link: docs/reference/plugins/extensions/auth-challenges text: auth challenge plugins).

The challenges can be configured with the following options:

### Code timeout

The timeout controls how long a generated login code is valid. The default is 10 minutes.

```php
<?php

return [
    'auth' => [
        'methods'   => ['code', 'password'],
        'challenge' => [
            'timeout' => 5 * 60 // 5 minutes
        ]
    ]
];
```

### Email options

You can customize the sender and the subject of the code emails:

```php
<?php

return [
    'auth' => [
        'methods'   => ['code', 'password'],
        'challenge' => [
            'timeout' => 5 * 60, // 5 minutes
            'email' => [
                'from'     => 'mail@example.com',
                'fromName' => 'My example project',
                'subject'  => 'Login code'
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

<info>
If you want to customize the emails even more, take a look how to (link: docs/guide/authentication/login-methods#email-templates text: customize the email templates) in the guide. Note also that this configuration is also used for the password-reset emails.
</info>

### Challenge priority

If multiple auth challenges are installed, you can define the priority of the challenges, i.e. which challenges are tried in which order:

```php
<?php

return [
    'auth' => [
        'challenges' => ['totp', 'email']
    ]
];
```

A challenge will be skipped if it isn't available in general or for the user who tries to log in (e.g. a TOTP challenge needs a prior registration, an SMS challenge needs the mobile number etc.).

The `email` challenge is always available as it doesn't need additional configuration (only in some cases the SMTP options). It is also enabled by default if no custom priorities are defined.

If none of the configured challenges is available, Kirby will "fake" the last configured challenge to avoid leaking security-relevant information (e.g. whether the user exists). In debug mode, there will be a clear error message instead.

## Auth debugging

Any errors during authentication (e.g. invalid email address, wrong password or code, rate limit, errors during code generation or sending...) are by default hidden from the user. The user only gets the message "Invalid login" or "Invalid code". This prevents various attacks such as user enumeration (where an attacker would be able find out which users are registered on a site).

The real errors are logged to PHP's error log. They can be used to find the actual source of a login failure.

If you don't have access to the PHP error log, you can **temporarily** enable auth debugging to send the real errors to the user:

```php
<?php

return [
    'auth' => [
        'debug' => true
    ]
];
```

<alert>
Make sure to disable the `auth.debug` mode in production! Displaying auth errors on a public server can be a serious security risk because they could leak information to attackers.

In a production environment, please use the PHP error log to debug issues wherever possible.
</alert>
