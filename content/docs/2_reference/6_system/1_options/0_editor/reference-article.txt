Intro: Sets the editor for the debugger

----

Text:

When your debug mode is enabled, you can set your editor to quickly open the file in which the error appeared.

(video: error.mp4)

```php
return [
	'debug'  => true,
	'editor' => 'vscode'
];
```

The following editors are supported:

| shortcut | Editor |
| - | - |
| `emacs`| Emacs |
| `idea`| IDEA |
| `macvim`| MacVim |
| `phpstorm`| PhpStorm |
| `sublime`| Sublime Text |
| `textmate`| Textmate |
| `xdebug`| xdebug |
| `vscode`| VSCode |
| `atom`| Atom |
| `espresso`| Espresso |
| `netbeans`| Netbeans |

<alert>
Make sure to disable `debug` mode in production! Displaying PHP errors on a public server can be a serious security risk:

- Error messages are displayed with detailed information about the code structure (e.g. file path, class, method)
- With Whoops enabled, there will be even more detailed information about the code structure

In a production environment, always log errors to your PHP error logs.
</alert>
