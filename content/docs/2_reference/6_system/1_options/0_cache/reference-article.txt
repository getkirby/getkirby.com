## Enabling/disabling the cache

```php
return [
  'cache' => [
    'pages' => [
      'active' => true
    ]
  ]
];
```

## Cache prefix

```php "/site/config/config.php"
return [
  'cache' => [
    'pages' => [
      'active' => true,
      'prefix' => 'example.com/pages'
    ]
  ]
];
```

You can read more about the cache prefix (link: docs/guide/cache#cache-drivers-and-options__cache-prefix text: in the guide).

## Cache driver

Set a different cache driver, default is the file driver.

```php
return [
  'cache' => [
    'pages' => [
      'active' => true,
      'type'   => 'memcached'
    ]
  ]
];
```

The following cache drivers are available:

| Cache Driver | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| FileCache | file | File System Cache Driver |
| ApcuCache | apcu | Driver for Apcu cache |
| MemCached | memcached | Driver for Memcached cache server |
| MemoryCache | memory | Driver for caching the current request in memory |
| NullCache | | Dummy Cache Driver (does not do any caching) |

You can also set a registered custom cache driver here. Check out the plugin reference (link: docs/reference/plugins/extensions/cache-drivers text: how to create a custom cache driver).

<info>
Make sure the selected cache driver is enabled on/supported by your server.

## Options for other cache types

The examples above set the options for the `pages` cache. You can use the same option structure for other caches, e.g. the `uuid` cache:

```php
return [
  'cache' => [
    'uuid' => [
      'type' => 'memcached'
    ]
  ]
];
```
