<alert>
The `servers` option has been removed from Kirby 4.3 â€“ Kirby does not restrict the list of servers anymore.
</alert>

This option can be used if you are using another web server that is (link: docs/guide/quickstart#requirements text: not officially supported by Kirby). With the option you can whitelist the server for the Panel.

## Example

```php
return [
    'servers' => ['apache', 'symfony']
];
```
