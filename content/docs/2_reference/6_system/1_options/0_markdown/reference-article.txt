## Additional tags: `markdown.extra`

Enables/disables the (link: https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/ text: Markdown Extra) parser with additional Markdown features like footnotes and tables.

```php
return [
  'markdown' => [
    'extra' => true
  ]
];
```

## Automatic line breaks: `markdown.breaks`

Enables/disables automatic line breaks in Markdown like on GitHub. Otherwise line breaks must be confirmed with three spaces at the end of the line.

Default: `true`

```php
return [
  'markdown' => [
    'breaks' => false
  ]
];
```

## Safe mode: `markdown.safe`

Enables/disables Parsedown's safe mode which escapes HTML code in the Markdown code and applies sanitization to scripting vectors (such as scripting link destinations) that are introduced by the Markdown syntax itself.

Default: `false`

```php
return [
  'markdown' => [
    'safe' => true
  ]
];
```
