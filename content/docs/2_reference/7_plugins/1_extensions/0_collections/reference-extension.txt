Text:

Collections are registered with the `collections` extension.

## Callback definition

 The `collections` extension accepts an array of collections where the key is the name of the collection and the value a callback function that returns the collection.

```php "/site/plugins/your-plugin/index.php"
Kirby::plugin('your/plugin', [
  'collections' => [
    'projects' => function ($site) {
      return $site->find('projects')->children()->listed();
    }
  ]
]);
```

## File definition

Alternatively, you can require a file. The required file would be a (link: docs/guide/templates/collections text: collection) with a return function.

```php
Kirby::plugin('your/plugin', [
  'collections' => [
    'articles' => require 'some/file.php'
  ]
]);
```

## Usage in templates

Once defined, you can use the collection in your templates using the [`collection()` helper](../helpers/collection).

```php "/site/templates/blog.php"
<?php foreach (collection('articles') as $article): ?>
  Author: <?= $article->author() ?>
  ...
<?php endforeach ?>
```
