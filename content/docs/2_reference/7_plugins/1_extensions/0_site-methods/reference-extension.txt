Text:

Site methods are registered with the `siteMethods` extension.

## Default site methods

**For a full (link: docs/reference/#site text: list of default site methods), please check out the (link: docs/reference/#site text: Reference).**

<info>Be aware that you cannot override these default site methods with any custom site method.</info>

## Getting started

You can extend the set of defined site methods very easily in a plugin file.

```php "/site/plugins/site-methods/index.php"
Kirby::plugin('my/plugin', [
  'siteMethods' => [
      'getSeoTitle' => function () {
          return $this->seoTitle()->isNotEmpty()? $this->seoTitle() : $this->title();
      }
  ]
]);
```

This example shows the basic architecture of a site method. You define the method name with the key for the `siteMethods` array. `$this` in the callback function is the `$site` object.

## Working with method arguments

In some cases it might be helpful to be able to pass arguments to the method:

```php
<?php dump($site->contact('Bastian Allgeier')) ?>
```

The definition for such a method with arguments is very straightforward:

```php
Kirby::plugin('my/plugin', [
    'siteMethods' => [
        'contact' => function ($name = '') {
          $contact = $this->contacts()->toStructure()->findBy('name',$name);
            return $contact;
        }
    ]
]);
```
