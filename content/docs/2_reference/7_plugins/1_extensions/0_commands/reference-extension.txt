Title: Commands

----

Text:

<info>
This feature of the Kirby CLI is currently in development. You need the latest develop branch version of `getkirby/cli`.
</info>

You can register new commands for the (link: https://github.com/getkirby/cli text: Kirby CLI) in your plugins with the `commands` extension.

```php "/site/plugins/your-plugin/index.php"
Kirby::plugin('your/plugin', [
  'commands' => [
    'your-plugin:test' => [
      'description' => 'Nice command',
      'args' => [],
      'command' => function ($cli) {
        $cli->success('My first plugin command');
      }
    ]
  ]
]);
```

Once your plugin is installed, the command can be executed with â€¦

```
kirby your-plugin:test
```

## Namespaces

We recommend to use such a namespace as in the example above.

```
your-plugin:test
your-plugin:another-task
```

Otherwise you might run into collisions with other commands from plugins. Core, local and global commands in the CLI always get registered first. If there's a command with the same name, your plugin command will be ignored.

## CLI Documentation

Please check out the CLI docs to find out how to create your commands, work with arguments and more.
