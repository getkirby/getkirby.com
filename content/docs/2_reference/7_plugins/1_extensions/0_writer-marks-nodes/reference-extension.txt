Title: Writer marks/nodes

----

Since: 4.0.0

Text:

The Writer is our rich-text editor powering the (link: docs/reference/panel/fields/writer text: writer field) and (link: docs/reference/panel/fields/list text: list field) but also the (link: docs/reference/panel/blocks/text text: text) and (link: docs/reference/panel/blocks/heading text: heading blocks), among others. In your plugin, you can add custom marks and nodes to enhance and customize the editing experience of those fields and blocks.

<info>
The Writer is built on top of (link: https://prosemirror.net/ text: ProseMirror). When diving deeper into your project, you will probably also need to consult the ProseMirror documentation for all details.

## Custom marks
A mark is a "a piece of information that can be attached to a node, such as it being emphasized, in code font, or a link" â€“ e.g. our default marks include bold, strike, sub, sup etc.

A custom mark automatically extends our (link: https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/blob/main/panel/src/components/Forms/Writer/Mark.js text: JavaScript `Mark` class) that functions as thin layer over the raw ProseMirror implementation. You can start building your mark from there:

```js "/site/plugins/your-plugin/index.js"
window.panel.plugin("your/plugin", {
  writerMarks: {
    highlight: {
      get button() {
        return {
          icon: "palette",
          label: window.panel.$t("color")
        }
      },

      commands() {
        return () => this.toggle()
      },

      get name() {
        return "highlight"
      },

      get schema() {
        return {
          parseDOM: [{ tag: "mark" }],
          toDOM: () => ["mark", 0]
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

You can also take a look at the (link: https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/blob/main/panel/src/components/Forms/Writer/Marks text: implementation of the default marks) as well as (link: https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.MarkSpec text: ProseMirror's mark docs).

## Custom nodes
A node represents some structured content in ProseMirror's document tree. Often this is rather seen as blocks, where marks are rather inline. Our default marks include the normal text paragraph, unordered/ordered lists, headings etc.

A custom node automatically extends our (link: https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/blob/main/panel/src/components/Forms/Writer/Node.js text: JavaScript `Node` class) that functions as thin layer over the raw ProseMirror implementation. You can start building your node from there:

```js "/site/plugins/your-plugin/index.js"
window.panel.plugin("your/plugin", {
  writerNodes: {
    quote: {
      get button() {
        return {
          icon: "quote",
          label: window.panel.$t("field.blocks.quote.name"),
        };
      },

      commands({ type, utils }) {
        return () => utils.toggleWrap(type);
      },

      get name() {
        return "quote";
      },

      get schema() {
        return {
          content: "block+",
          group: "block",
          defining: true,
          draggable: false,
          parseDOM: [
            {
              tag: "blockquote"
            }
          ],
          toDOM: () => ["blockquote", 0]
        };
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## Using custom marks/nodes in your fields

Learn how to (link: docs/reference/panel/fields/writer#choosing-available-marks text: activate your custom mark or node). This also works for blocks, when you extend or overwrite e.g. the (link: docs/reference/panel/blocks/text#default-files__blueprint text: text blocks' blueprint) to add the right options to the block's text field (which is a writer type field by default).

## Troubleshooting

### HTML tags/attributes gets removed when saving

If you run into issues where HTML tags/attributes get removed when saving, it is likely due to them not being allowed by our HTML sanitizer by default.

To allow your specific tags/attributes, you can modify the list of allowed tags/attributes in the [`Kirby\Sane\Html` class](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/blob/main/src/Sane/Html.php), e.g.

```php "/site/config/config.php"
use Kirby\Sane\Html;

Html::$allowedTags['span'] = ['title', 'class'];
```


### Competing with other nodes/mark

When implementing a custom node/mark, your `parseDOM` rules might compete with rules from other nodes/marks. E.g. your custom node targets a `<p>` tag with a specific class, while the default paragraph node targets all `<p>` tags. This can lead to problems, when the broader `parseDOM` rule gets checked before the more specific one.

If you run into issues here, you can use the (link: https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.GenericParseRule.priority text: `priority` option) and choose a value higher than 50 (which is the default) to ensure your `parseDOM` rule gets checked first.
