Text:

Darkroom drivers are responsible for resizing, cropping and modifying images using Kirby's thumb API.

You can create your own custom darkroom drivers by extending one of the existing drivers or the base `Darkroom` class.

## Extending an existing darkroom driver

To modify only parts of an existing driver like the `ImageMagick` driver, you can extend that class and selectively overwrite individual methods, e.g. the `convert()` method in this example:

```php "/site/plugins/your-plugin/index.php"
class CustomImageMagick extends Kirby\Image\Darkroom\ImageMagick
{
    protected function convert(string $file, array $options): string
    {
        // your custom code
        // ...

        return parent::convert($file, $options);
    }
}
```

You then have to register the new darkroom driver:

```php
Kirby\Image\Darkroom::$types['custom-im'] = CustomImageMagick::class;
```

## Extending the `Darkroom` class

Alternatively, you can extend the `Darkroom` class to implement a new darkroom driver.

```php "/site/plugins/your-plugin/index.php"
class SuperDriver extends Kirby\Image\Darkroom
{
    // implement methods here
}
```

As before, you have to register the new darkroom driver:

```php
Kirby\Image\Darkroom::$types['super'] = SuperDriver::class;
```
