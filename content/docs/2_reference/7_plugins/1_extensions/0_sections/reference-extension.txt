Title: Sections

Guide: blueprints/layout

Text:

In the Panel you can use sections to layout each view. By default, Kirby offers sections for pages, files, fields and info boxes. Those can be arranged in columns and tabs to give you an incredibly powerful setup for each content type.

With section plugins there's hardly any use case or integration that could not be covered by the Panel.

## Fields vs. Sections

As a rule of thumb **field plugins** should be used if content is stored in any way. That can be simple form inputs, but also something like our structure field that stores its content as yaml.

**Section plugins** should be used for anything else that you want to integrate in the Panel interface.

Just like fields, sections can be used in any blueprint — no matter if it's the site.yml, page blueprints, file blueprints or user blueprints.

## What makes a section plugin?

- PHP code for the REST API: `index.php`
- Vue code for the Panel: `index.js`
- Optional CSS: `index.css`

## PHP definition

Let's start with a PHP plugin file.

```php "/site/plugins/modified/index.php"
Kirby::plugin('yourname/modified', [
    'sections' => [
        'modified' => [
            // the section code goes here
        ]
    ]
]);
```

The array key `modified` sets the section type that can later be used in your blueprints.

### Section properties

Sections can have many options in your blueprint, such as a label or the layout option for pages and files.

Those property values from the blueprint will be sent to the section via the REST API and the Vue component can work with them to display the section accordingly.

Properties are defined with the `props` array

```php "/site/plugins/modified/index.php"
Kirby::plugin('yourname/modified', [
    'sections' => [
        'modified' => [
            'props' => [
                'label' => function ($label) {
                    return $label;
                }
            ]
        ]
    ]
]);
```

A property is always a combination of a key (the property name) and a function (the property setter).

The property definition above instructs the REST API to process the value from the blueprint:

```yaml "Blueprint"
modified:
  type: modified
  label: Last updates
```

```js "API response"
modified: {
  label: "Last updates"
}
```

**Required properties**

```php
'props' => [
    'label' => function ($label) {
        return $label;
    }
]
```
**Optional properties**

```php
'props' => [
    'label' => function ($label = null) {
        return $label;
    }
]
```
**Default values**

```php
'props' => [
    'label' => function ($label = 'Last modified') {
        return $label;
    }
]
```

**Type hinting**

```php
'props' => [
    'label' => function (string $label) {
        return $label;
    }
]
```

**Translated values**

```php
'props' => [
    'label' => function ($label = null) {
        return I18n::translate($label);
    }
]
```

**Modified properties**

```php
'props' => [
    'label' => function (string $label) {
        return 'Section: ' . $label;
    }
]
```

### Computed values

If you need to pass additional values to the field, that are not defined by properties in the blueprint, you can use computed values.

```php "/site/plugins/modified/index.php"
Kirby::plugin('yourname/modified', [
    'sections' => [
        'modified' => [
            'props' => [
                'label' => function (string $label) {
                    return $label;
                },
            ],
            'computed' => [
                'text' => function () {
                    return 'The page has been modified at ' . $this->model()->modified('d.m.Y H:i:s');
                }
            ]
        ]
    ]
]);
```

```yaml "Blueprint"
modified:
    type: modified
    label: Last update
```

```js "API Response"
modified: {
    label: "Last update",
    text: "The page has been modified at 12.12.2012 22:33:00",
}
```

### API endpoints

You can set up custom API endpoints for your section, if needed, by adding an `api` entry with a callback function that returns an array of endpoint definitions:

```php
'api' => function() {
  return [
    [
      'pattern' => '/say-hello',
      'action' => function () {
        return [
          'message' => 'Hello, World!'
        ];
      }
    ]
  ];
}
```

With the route defined on the backend, you can now access it in the Panel with the `$api` helper methods:

```js
const response = await this.$api.get('/pages/blog+article-a/sections/sectionName/say-hello');
```

Note how the API pattern of your custom endpoint is prefixed by the path to the specific page it's used on as well as `/sections/` and the section name it is included in.

## Vue component

After finishing the PHP backend part of the section, we can now start developing the (glossary: vue) component. Although our Vue plugin API is really easy to read, it makes sense to check out the [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/), if you have never worked with it.

First, we will need an additional `index.js` file for our javascript code:

```js "/site/plugins/modified/index.js"
panel.plugin('yourname/modified', {
  sections: {
    modified: {
      // your field code goes here.
      // very similar to the backend!
    }
  }
});
```

### Just a Vue component

Though we have added some wrapper code, the section object is just a normal Vue component definition. You can check out the [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/) for all component options and use them all.

### Section data

Unlike field components, all sections are loaded asynchrounously and only receive their data from the backend when they are loaded. This way we can build complex sections without blocking the rest of the interface.

Each section plugin automatically inherits a load method, that can be used to load the data from the backend.

To fetch the options from the backend, you must define the data object first and then populate it, when the section gets loaded. Here's an example:

```js "/site/plugins/modified/index.js"
panel.plugin('yourname/modified', {
  sections: {
    modified: {
      data: function () {
        return {
          label: null,
          text: null
        }
      },
      created: async function() {
        const response = await this.load();
        this.label = response.label;
        this.text  = response.text;
      }
    }
  }
});
```

This has to be done for all properties as well as computed values defined in the (link: #php-definition text: PHP section definition).

### Template

Once the data is loaded, we can work with it in the template.

```js "/site/plugins/modified/index.js"
panel.plugin('yourname/modified', {
  sections: {
    modified: {
      data: function () {
        return {
          label: null,
          text: null
        }
      },
      created: async function() {
        const response = await this.load();
        this.label = response.label;
        this.text  = response.text;
      },
      template: `
        <section class="k-modified-section">
          <k-label>{{ label }}</k-label>
          <k-text>{{ text }}</k-text>
        </section>
      `
    }
  }
});
```

## CSS styles

If you need additional CSS for your section plugin, you can create an optional `index.css`. Kirby will automatically concatenate and load this in combination with the other plugins' CSS files.

Please make sure to check for our (link: docs/reference/plugins/ui text: UI kit components) and available styles before you implement your own CSS rules for something that already exists.
