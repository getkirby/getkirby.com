Text:

Routes are registered with the `routes` extension.

The extension accepts an array of routes, where each route is defined as an array of key/value pairs. You have to define at least a pattern and an action.

```php "/site/plugins/your-plugin/index.php"
Kirby::plugin('your/plugin', [
  'routes' => [
    [
      'pattern' => 'my/awesome/url',
      'action'  => function () {
        // do something here when the URL matches the pattern above
      }
    ]
  ]
]);
```

Routes can also be registered as callbacks. Within the callback they have full access to the current Kirby instance.

```php
Kirby::plugin('demo/plugin', [
  'routes' => function ($kirby) {
    return [
      [
        'pattern' => '...',
        'action' => function () {

        }
      ]
    ];
  }
]);
```
