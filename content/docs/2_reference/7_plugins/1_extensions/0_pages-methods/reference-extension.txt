Text:

Pages methods are registered with the `pagesMethods` extension.

## Default pages methods

**For a full (link: docs/reference/#pages text: list of default pages methods), please check out the Reference.**

<info>Be aware that you cannot override these default pages methods with any custom pages method.</info>

## Getting started

You can extend the set of defined pages methods very easily in a plugin file.

```php "/site/plugins/pages-methods/index.php"
Kirby::plugin('my/pagesMethods', [
    'pagesMethods' => [
        'listAll' => function () {
            foreach($this as $page) {
                echo '- ' . $page->title() . '<br>';
            }
        }
    ]
]);
```

This example shows the basic architecture of a pages method. You define the method name with the key for the `pagesMethods` array. `$this` in the callback function is the `$pages` collection.

## Working with method arguments

In some cases it might be helpful to be able to pass arguments to the method:

```php
<?= $pages->withGame('Mario Kart 64') ?>
```

The definition for such a method with arguments is very simple:

```php
Kirby::plugin('my/plugin', [
    'pagesMethods' => [
        'withGame' => function ($game) {
            return $this->filterBy('game', $game);
        }
    ]
]);
```
