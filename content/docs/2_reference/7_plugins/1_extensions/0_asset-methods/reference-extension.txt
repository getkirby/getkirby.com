Title: Asset methods

----

Text:

Asset methods are registered with the `assetMethods` extension.

They are used for all `Kirby/Filesystem/Asset` objects returned by the `asset()` helper whenever there is no built-in method with the same name.

## Default asset methods

**For a full (link: docs/reference/objects/filesystem/asset text: list of default asset methods), please check out the Reference.**

<info>Be aware that you cannot override these default asset methods with any custom asset method.</info>

## Getting started

You can extend the set of defined asset methods in a plugin file.

```php "/site/plugins/asset-methods/index.php"
Kirby::plugin('my/plugin', [
    'assetMethods' => [
         'yourMethodName' => function () {
            // ...
        }
    ]
]);
```
