Details:

The `$final` argument tells you whether the specific route was used by the router (in which case `$final` is `true`) or skipped because the route called `$this->next()` (in which case `$final` is `false`).

## When is the hook triggered

- Kirby is set up
- The routes are loaded
- The router is created
- The router tries to find a matching route
- The `route:before` hook is triggered
- The route action is executed
- Within the route the route action is executed (a page rendered, deleted, or whatever the script does)
- The `route:after` hook is triggered with the result of the route action
