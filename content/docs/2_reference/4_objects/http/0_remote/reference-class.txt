## How to get a `$remote` object


```php
<?php
$response = new Remote('https://example.com');

echo $response->code(); // e.g. 200
echo $response->url(); // https://example.com
echo $response->method(); // GET

dump($response->content());
```

Note that instantiating the object will fetch the data.

You can also get an object by calling the `Remote::request()echo ` method or one of the shortcuts;


### Shortcuts

Instead of using `Remote::request()` with the request method defined in the `$params` array, you can use the HTTP method names as method:

- `Remote::get()`, see (link: docs/reference/objects/http/remote/get text: `$remote::get()`)
- `Remote::post()`
- `Remote::delete()`
- `Remote::patch()`
- `Remote::put()`
- `Remote::head()`


This works, because the `Remote` class implements the `__callStatic` magic method, which makes sure to execute not explicitely defined static methods.
