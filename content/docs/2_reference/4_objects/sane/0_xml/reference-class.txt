## Restrict domains

By default, the sanitizer allows any kind of domains included in the XML file as they can be pretty common in many XML-based formats.

If you want to further restrict the allowed domains, you can set the following public attribute to a list of allowed domains:

```php
Kirby\Sane\Xml::$allowedDomains = ['https://getkirby.com'];
```
