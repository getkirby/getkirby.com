## `$who`

There are four options for the `$who` parameter:
- a username (impersonates the specific user with their permissions)
- `'kirby'` (impersonates the allmighty user with full permissions)
- `'nobody'` (disables the currently logged in user)
- `null` (resets the impersonation)

## Example

```php
<?php

$kirby = kirby();
$kirby->impersonate('kirby');

page('notes/a-great-article')->update([
  'author' => 'Homer Simpson'
]);
```

<warning>
The impersonation will be active for all code that runs in the current request after the call to `$kirby->impersonate()`. If you want to limit the impact to a single operation, call the method with a callback (see below).
</warning>

## With callback

If you only want a single operation to run with different privileges, use a callback:

```php
<?php

$kirby = kirby();
$result = $kirby->impersonate('kirby', function () {
  page('notes/a-great-article')->update([
    'author' => 'Homer Simpson'
  ]);

  return 'this will be returned to $result above';
});
```

The impersonation automatically gets reset to the previous value after the callback returns.
