## How to create a `$user` object

Before you can call the methods of the User class, you need a `$user` object.

The `$user` object is available via the `$kirby` object:

### The current user

```php
$user = $kirby->user();
```

### A specific user by user id or email address
```php
$user = $kirby->user('you@yourdomain.com');
```

### The first user of the users collection
```php
$user = $kirby->users()->first();
```

<info>
Before calling any of the methods of the User class, verify that you have a valid User object.
</info>

Examples:

With the `$user` object in place, you can use the methods of the user class to get information about the user or modify the user object.

### Check if the user is an admin

```php
if ($user->isAdmin()) {
  echo "Hey, great, you can do anything you like!"
}
```

### Convert user object to array

```php
$userData = $user->toArray();
```

### Change the user name programmatically

```php
$user->changeName('new-name');
```

### Fetch all files belonging to the user object

```php
$userFiles = $user->files();
```

<info>
To keep the examples short, we don't [check if the (user) object exists](docs/cookbook/php/php-templates#and-one-last-trick) in the examples above. In your code, you should always do that.
