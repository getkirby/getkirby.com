## How to get a `$files` object

Before you can use the methods of the `$files` class, you need a `$files` object. To get a files object, you fetch the files you need from the `$site`, `$page` or `$user` object:

<info>
Note that the default sorting order of files is according to their order in the file system. To sort files by their manual sorting order, you can use `$files->sortBy('sort')`, where `sort` is the field that stores the sorting number if you manually sort files in the Panel.
</info>

### Site files

```php
$files = $site->files();
```

### Page files

```php
$files = $page->files();
```

### User files

```php
$files = $user->files();
```

----

Examples:

With the `$files` object defined, you can now do all sorts of things:

### Filter files

```php
$filteredFiles = $files->filterBy('template', 'cover');
```

### Group files

```php
$groupedFiles = $files->groupBy('template');
```

### Get the first file of the collection


```php
$firstFile = $files->first();
```

### Only get three files

```php
$files = $files->limit(3);
```
