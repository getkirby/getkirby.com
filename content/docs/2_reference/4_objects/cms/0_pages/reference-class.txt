## How to get a `$pages` object

The `$pages` variable is available by default in templates and snippets and refers to a collection of all first level pages. In addition to that, you can define a `$pages` object in various ways:

### Children of a page
```php
$pages = $page->children();
```

### All pages of the site
```php
$pages = $site->index();
```

### A custom combination of pages
```php
// find specific pages in the site
$pages = $site->find('blog', 'projects', 'contact');

// find specific subpages
$pages = $page->find('article-a', 'article-b');
```

Examples:

With the `$pages` object in place, we can start using the methods of this class to do many different things:

### Filter the collection by any criterium

```php
$articles = $pages->filterBy('date', '>', time());
```

### Get only listed pages

```php
$articles = $pages->listed()
```
### Get all files of all the pages in the collection

```php
$files = $pages->files();
```

### Get the first/last page

```php
$firstPage = $pages->first();
$lastPage = $pages->last();
```

### Sort pages

```php
$sorted = $pages->sortBy(fn ($page) => $page->date()->toDate(), 'desc');
```
