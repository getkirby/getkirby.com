## What are blocks?

When you want to work with the content of a (link: docs/reference/panel/fields/blocks text: Blocks field), you would use the (method: $field::toBlocks text: toBlocks) field method to convert it to a Blocks collection - a collection of `Kirby\Cms\Block` objects. The Blocks collection makes it easy to render the entire set of blocks or loop through blocks and create individual HTML for them.
