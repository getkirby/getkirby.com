## What is a code file?

Kirby considers the following file types as code:

- js
- css
- scss
- rb
- xml
- json
- java

Any html or php files cannot be uploaded to pages for security reasons.

----

Examples:

```php
echo $page->hasCode(); //will echo 1 if true, nothing if false

if ($page->hasCode()) {
  $codeFiles = $page->code();
}
```
