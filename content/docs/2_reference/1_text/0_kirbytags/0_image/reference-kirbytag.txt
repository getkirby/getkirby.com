### Image with defined `width` and `height` attributes

```kirbytext

Width and height can also be set to auto, which will automatically be replaced by the actual image dimensions.

```kirbytext
(\image: cat.jpg width: auto height: auto)
```

This behaviour can also be set as global default for all image kirbytags in your config file.

```php
// config.php
'kirbytext' => [
	'image' => [
		'width' => 'auto',
		'height' => 'auto',
	]
];
```
### Image with `srcset` with absolut sizes

```kirbytext
(\image: foo.jpg srcset: 200, 300)
```

### Image with `srcset` from a config srcset name

Use srcset defaults you defined in the (link: docs/reference/system/options/thumbs#srcsets text: `thumbs` config option):

```kirbytext
(\image: foo.jpg srcset: album)
```
