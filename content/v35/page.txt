## Pre-release candidates

<info>
This is a pre-release and probably not fully stable yet. Don't use in production unless you don't mind potential hick-ups. We really appreciate your help while testing this release candidate!

### How to test the pre-release?

### Reporting issues

Please use our regular Github issues to report any issues with the release candidates: https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues

## New Blocks Field
The [Kirby Builder](https://getkirby.com/plugins/timoetting/builder) by Tim Ötting is one of the most popular plugins out there and together with Tim we decided to add it to the core 🎉

We've rewritten it from scratch and merged it with our popular [Editor](https://getkirby.com/plugins/getkirby/editor) plugin. The new field is called Blocks and will eventually replace both plugins.

## New Layouts field
Together with the new Blocks field we are also introducing a powerful new Layout field. Arrange blocks in multiple columns and build complex page layouts.

## New Date and Time fields
We've never been really happy with our date field and many of you weren't either. The new date and time fields are a joy to work with and open completely new ways to enter dates.

## New Writer field
You don't need the full power of the Blocks? Maybe just some inline HTML? Then the new Writer field is here for you. Create single-line HTML with formats like bold, italic, underline or links

## New List field
As another spin-off of the Blocks field, we also added a new list field, which can be used if you need to create simple ordered or unordered lists in a more visual way than with Markdown.

## Enhanced Authentication

With 3.5 we are introducing major enhancements for our login flow.

(screenshot: v35/authentication/login.png link: v35/authentication)

You can now reset your password, login password-less via secure email verification code and even provide your own verification methods via auth challenge plugins. Combine this with the option to enable 2FA authentication to increase the security of your Panel.
