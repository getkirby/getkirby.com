Description:

Growing up in a German bakery, I learned that craftsmanship requires both precision and creativity. Today, I apply these same principles to web development.

I create websites where creativity and accessibility work together. As a certified Kirby Partner, I build individual, easy-to-edit websites that stay true to design intentions. My work focuses on thoughtful interactions while ensuring every user can access and enjoy the experience.

My journey from designer to developer gives me a unique perspective: I understand both the creative vision and the technical requirements needed to bring it to life. This makes me an ideal partner for designers who want their work brought to life exactly as they imagined.
