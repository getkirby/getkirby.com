Description:

Growing up as a baker's son in Germany, I was exposed to the art of crafting and creating at a young age. Over 15 years ago, I began exploring the world of website design and development, combining my creative flair with effective functionality.

In 2013, I discovered Kirby and instantly fell in love. After working at several advertising agencies, I finally dared to take the step into self-employment. In fact, Kirby 2 was the main reason I started freelancing because I was confident that I could build any project with it — no matter how complex.
