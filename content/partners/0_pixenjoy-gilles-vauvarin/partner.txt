Description:

Hi, my name is Gilles, I'm a web developer for over 25 years and I fell in love with the Kirby CMS in 2016 for its flexibility, simplicity and user experience.

I help my clients define their needs and translate them into elegant IT/Kirby solutions.

I live in Montreal most of the year and in France the rest of the time. I work alone or in collaboration with other profiles according to my clients' needs.

I would be happy to discuss your project with you, please feel free to come and talk to me about your plans to see how I can best help or advise you.

See you soon :-)
