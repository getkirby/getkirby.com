Description:

We are Updutch, a small team with over 20 years of combined experience in web design and development. We create websites that don’t just look good, but are technically solid as well. Whether you’re a new entrepreneur or an established business, we build a website that truly fits you. We keep things simple, clear, and focused on results, always with a personal touch.
Our services range from web design and development to UX/UI consulting and optimizations. Every business is unique, so we don’t work with standard packages. Instead, we listen closely to your specific needs and requirements to develop a product, service, or solution that matches exactly what you’re looking for, and delivers real value.
Every site is mobile-friendly, visually engaging, accessible and optimized to turn visitors into customers. And with a simple setup using tools that are easy to use, like Kirby, you stay in full control of your online presence.
