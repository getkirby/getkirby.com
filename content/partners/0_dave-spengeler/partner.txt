Description:

Hi, I'm Dave, a freelance designer and web developer. With over twelve years in design, web development, and team leadership at creative agencies, I ventured into freelancing in 2022.

## Designer Who Codes
My focus is on planning and designing web projects, and enhancing brand identities. I offer technical expertise in coding responsive, performance-optimized websites with Kirby CMS, along with visual design services like logo creation, corporate identity, and UI/web design.

## Agency Partner
I work with agencies that need their designs coded into functional websites and value a partner who brings a strong visual perspective to the table. I also collaborate with startups and companies aiming to build or boost their brands, offering them a comprehensive range of services from one source.
