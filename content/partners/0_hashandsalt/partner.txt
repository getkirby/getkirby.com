Description:

**Expertise**

By blending more than 20 years of experience with building sites for some of the worlds best known brands, we have a wealth of knowledge. From designing eye catching sites to creating fast and efficient code that is battle ready for today's mobile focused consumers, you can be sure of excellent results.

Every site we build is hand designed and hand built. We spent 10 years making our own in house tools to do the job efficiently and quickly to a very high standard.

We do not use paid for templates or stock elements. Every site is thoroughly tested for performance and hosted only with providers that can help us achieve speeds that are well above average.

**Studio**

[Hash&Salt](https://hashandsalt.com/) was founded by James Steel. Built on the belief that every business should have access to effective design and marketing services, without the high price tag that usually comes from working with agencies.

With over 20 years experience, we specialise in producing fast, well designed websites for businesses around the world. Catering for any type of business or service, we have particular experience with Viticulturists, tasting rooms, and those working within the hospitality industry.
