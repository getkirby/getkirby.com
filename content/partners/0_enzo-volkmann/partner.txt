Description:

I am a freelance web developer with over 10 years of experience, based in Kassel, Germany.

I am not a salesperson quickly looking for the next deal, I rather
see myself as a reliable and long-term technical partner for my clients.

I enjoy diving into the businesses of my clients, understanding
their processes and building efficient digital solutions that work.

### Webdesign & Website development

I create websites for people and businesses across all sectors.
With the power of Kirby, I can create tailor-made sites that
are not only performant and nice to look at, but also easy and intuitive to maintain.

I strive to build clean, fast, accessible sites that work well
for humans and robots. I care about the details of the web-platform
and like to use them as intended and as best as possible; resulting in a high-quality site.

I can help you with content-migration, user-onboarding and support too.

### Digitalization and Application Development

I help you bring your processes into the digital world.
Over the years, I have designed, developed (and still maintain) several
business-apps that are used and trusted day-in and day-out; handling
hundreds of users, thousands of clients and millions of Euros.

That also includes custom development with Kirby as a platform
that goes beyond the classic website use-case.

I believe that many businesses can profit from custom software that
exactly matches their needs and processes. More ownership and privacy, less dependencies. And often more affordable than you think.

I work with a data-driven approach, focusing on a functional and
well-designed data-model that matches and represents your business.
On top of that, a modern and safe web-app architecture is built.

### Custom Web Development

Sometimes, you don't need a whole new site or app. I develop custom
integrations to connect legacy systems; enhance a web-shop with a
configurator or help building your own custom software-library...

No matter the problem or idea, the web-platform offers the tools to build it.

### AI

I help you integrate AI into your digital products, with custom
agents, tools and domain-knowledge that enable real benefits.

I use AI for productivity in my daily work, but I reject the idea
of "vibe-coding". I see real benefits by carefully defining tasks,
critical checking and automated test-suites that ensure high-quality and safe code.
