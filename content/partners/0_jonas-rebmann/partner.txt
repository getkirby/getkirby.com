Description:

**Hi, I’m Jonas.**
For over 10 years, I’ve been building custom Kirby websites with a creative focus on telling stories and ideas in engaging and sometimes unexpected ways. The message sticks, helped by the visual language it’s told in.

My projects are easy for everyone to use, thanks to clearly designed user experiences and Kirby backends tailored to each client and their site. I pay close attention to performance, SEO, and clean, efficient code.

As a developer, I always think like a designer, too. Which makes me a strong partner for planning and building bigger projects together.

**Sounds good?**
Have a look at my website and get in touch! I’m already looking forward to working with you.
