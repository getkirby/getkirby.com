Description:

I'm Alexandros Papadopoulos, a freelance web designer and developer based in Kavala, Greece.

I design websites with a clear purpose — to communicate ideas and content in ways that are both meaningful and visually engaging. On the development side, I am a strong advocate of the web platform. I favor lean, vanilla front-end solutions and focus on building fast, accessible, and sustainable websites. For content management, I use Kirby exclusively — its flexibility, performance, and supportive community make it a perfect fit for my workflow.

I'm always interested in new ideas, collaborations, and conversations. Feel free to reach out!
