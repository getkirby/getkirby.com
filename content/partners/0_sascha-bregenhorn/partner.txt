Description:

I am a full-time designer and developer running a one-person independent studio near Münster, Germany. I offer **web design**, **web development**, and also **graphic design** services.

With over **25 years of experience** in the industry—as an intern, employee, employer, freelancer, business owner, and entrepreneur—I’ve worn many different hats. Although I now focus primarily on design and development, my clients benefit from my broad understanding of the industry’s various fields and perspectives.

Kirby CMS has been my first choice since version 1. With the release of version 3 in 2019, I stopped offering other content management systems and now work **exclusively** with Kirby CMS.

**Interested?**
Take a look at my website and drop me a line: <hi@n2.studio>. I’m excited to hear about your project!

----

Expertise: Custom websites with a focus on **design** and performance-driven, mobile-first **frontend development**.
