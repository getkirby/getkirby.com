Description:

As a web developer I have been realizing websites for over 15 years. Pragmatic, functional, without unnecessary data clutter, with a special eye for design and form and always with the latest web standards for mobile devices and PCs.

Scalable in scope, function and content and always designed to meet the needs of my clients.

I develop websites for small and medium-sized companies, agencies, freelancers and associations; all of them people and organizations that attach particular importance to a solid, up-to-date and future-oriented basis for their presentation on the Internet.

And soon also for you.
