Description:

We are hana+nils, a multidisciplinary design studio from Braunschweig, Germany, creating visual designs for digital and analog media. Tailored to your project’s requirements, our studio offers all necessary steps from concept through implementation to build your website.

### From Frontend to Backend
We believe that good design involves great expertise in all parts of the system. This is why we pair our knowledge in design with a deep understanding of the web platform, using semantic HTML, CSS and JavaScript as our base for a Kirby setup that fits your needs.

### Communication by Design
For us, shared conversation plays a central role in the process of building a site. Analysis, research, and a critical examination of the initial situation and objectives lead us to strong concepts for content, structure and design. Our primary goal is to clearly communicate what you have to say. To achieve this, we strive for structural and typographic clarity, and draw on the interaction of color, form, time and space.

### Project Management
Reliable project management forms the foundation of our work. We plan and coordinate working with you and with other parties as required.

_We are Johanna and Nils Hörrmann, husband and wife, working together since 2011 as Büro für Gestaltung in Braunschweig, Germany. We speak German and English and work remotely as well as on location._
