Title: What do I need to keep in mind for the code review project?
----
Text:

The project you submit for code review (only for Certified partners) must meet the following requirements:

- The project must be a Kirby 3 or (ideally) 4 project.
- The project must be a published project that is available via a public URL for performance testing.
- The project must include steps for local installation and must contain all data required to run the project without errors.
- For privacy reasons, the project should not contain user accounts; if it does contain accounts, provide information which account can be used for testing.
- The submitted project should not include the media folder, sessions and cache.
- The Panel location should be communicated if different from default.

We will evaluate the following areas:

- Kirby version
- Coding style
- Semantics & accessibility
- Code documentation
- Modularity
- Performance
- Panel layout
- Opinionated code
- Responsiveness
- Debug mode handling
- Privacy
- Installation process

Your review project does not have to be perfect in all of these areas. We understand that there are often budgetary reasons and other constraints beyond your control. Our goal of the code review is to ensure that our partners' clients can expect solid and long-lasting work.
