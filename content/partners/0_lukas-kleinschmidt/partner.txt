Description:

Working in the web industry for over 10 years, I've gained a lot of experience in various fields and have build custom shop systems, applications and websites for a wide range of clients. In addition to standards like <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code> and <code>JavaScript</code>, I'm fluent in <code>Kirby</code> and <code>Laravel</code> and work with <code>Vue.js</code> for state-driven or highly interactive frontends.

My main focus is on PHP-based web applications and websites. I have been supporting companies and NGOs in the digitization of work processes and internal structures for several years now.

I'm also a big fan of open-source software and always happy to contribute to the community, escpecially when it comes to Kirby.

I completed several other Kirby projects at my previous employer, which unfortunately I cannot showcase publicly. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my work.
