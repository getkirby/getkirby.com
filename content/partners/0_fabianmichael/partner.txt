Description:

Hi, I work as an independent web designer and developer for agencies, businesses and startups of various sizes from all over the world. I am happy to assist you with your next project to create unique and bespoke solutions for you or your clients. My goal is to build long-lasting relationships with my clients and contribute to their success.

I am both happy to do everything from concept to the final deployment of your project but also feel comfortable filling out a clearly defined role in your team and focusing on one thing, whereas design or development are clearly preferred. Over the years, Iâ€™ve developed a network of multidisciplinary specialist partners I can ask to join forces in case your project has demands in fields where I do not have the expertise myself.

With over 15 years of professional experience in the web industry, I have seen many trends come and go, but I have been a happy Kirby developer ever since 2015 and have completed over 25 Kirby-driven projects by now. Kirby allows me to build websites of almost any scale and allows me to build long-lasting, accessible and economically sustainable websites for clients of any size.
