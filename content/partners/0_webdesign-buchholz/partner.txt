Description:

As a student in the 1990s, I developed my first websites with the then still limited possibilities of the Internet. The joy of digitally implementing creative ideas has grown more and more with the now almost unlimited possibilities of modern programming languages for the web.

Every website I create is unique, and is developed from scratch. I always plan, design, create and develop websites in close consultation with my clients. My work is done when you are 100% satisfied with your new website.
