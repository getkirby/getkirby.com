Description:

Over the past 10+ years I tried to lend my skills to bridge the gap between the traditional graphic design world and the world wide web. I am a designer who codes as well as a developer with an eye for good and minimal design. I have a passion for digital typography, a love for minimalism, and a deep appreciation of lightweight websites.

## You should work with me if…
- You need a developer with an eye for design details or if you want someone to design and code a custom website for you with a very minimal aesthetic. 
- You appreciate good typography and clean design.
- You understand that good design requires time and dedication.

## You should not work with me if…
- You need an ecommerce website. I don't do those.
- You want a website that follows the web trend of the day.
- You want a website that is flashy and animated and interactive.
