Summary: Web dev freelance | Kirby CMS

Description:

I’m Jonas, a Belgian freelance designer / developer with 12+ years of experience. I work as a technical partner for agencies, studios, entrepreneurs and organizations who need someone reliable to design, build and maintain custom Kirby websites.

I combine design sensitivity with solid development skills, so I can translate concepts into clean, fast and easy-to-manage solutions. I focus on well-structured content, custom panels, multilingual sites, performance, accessibility and SEO, without unnecessary complexity.

Clients appreciate that I work autonomously, integrate smoothly into existing teams and stay available after launch for hosting, support and long-term maintenance.

Based in Bali, I collaborate remotely with clients across Europe and beyond. If you’re looking for a trusted partner who can take ownership of your Kirby projects from start to finish, I’d be happy to connect.
