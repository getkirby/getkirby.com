Description:

Wrote my first HTML code in 1996. I practice professional website design and development since over 15 years. I worked for 8 years as Lead Frontend Designer at Digitalagentur helllicht and realise now projects as freelance web designer. I know Kirby since version 1 and since then I follow the development of this great CMS.

I'm also a professional writer of novels, crime and plays and published them in publishing houses like Piper and Kiepenheuer & Witsch. With this expertise, I often work on projects for institutions in the arts and culture.
