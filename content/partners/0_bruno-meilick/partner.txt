Description:

### Bruno Meilick

With a background in Software Development and a Bachelor's degree in Interaction Design from ZHdK (Switzerland, 2009), I focused on Web Development early in my career. I now live in central Ireland with my wife and four kids.

### Kirby Mastery

I've been part of the Kirby community since 2015, working on over 50 projects using Kirby for websites and custom tools. I create many free plugins because I believe in open source for education and code stability.

### Front- and Backend Development

**Bridging the gap.** As a freelancer and agency employee, I’ve planned and created websites, often serving as the bridge between designers and developers.

**Less is more.** As a minimalist, I make websites fast, lean, and user-friendly for visitors and editors. I use various coding techniques and caching layers to speed things up, customize workflows with Panel extensions, and provide Web UX Design consulting.

**Think first, act later.** I excel in projects with complex setups involving large datasets, multiple data sources, or integrations with external services. I approach these challenges with solid planning, Test-Driven Development, and collaboration with other professionals when needed.

**All or parts.** While I prefer working on projects from start to finish, you can hire me for specific tasks, like importing data from a database or optimizing your existing website’s performance.

**Klub Plugin.** I offer a paid extension to Kirby CMS called Klub, which supports paywalls, memberships, and subscriptions.
