Description:

### Bruno Meilick

With my background as a trained Software Developer and graduated Bachelor in Interaction Design ZHdK (Switzerland, 2009), I specialized in Web-Development early in my career. I live on the West Coast of Ireland with my wife and four kids.

### Kirby mastery
Since I joined the Kirby community back in 2015, I have created more than 50 projects utilizing Kirby for websites and custom tools. I create many free plugins because I believe in open source for educational purposes and as a means of code stability.

### Front- and Backend Development

**Way and Bridge.** During my work as a hired freelancer or employee of design agencies, I was planning and creating websites as well as acting as middle between designers and developers.

**Less is more.** Being a minimalist at heart I focus on making websites fast, lean and easy to use for both the visitors and the editors. I apply various coding tricks and layers of caches to speed things up, map client workflows to custom Panel extensions or can consult you on Web UX Design.

**Think first, act later.** Projects with complex setups like with a lot of data, multiple data sources or connections/export to external services are right up my alley of expertise. I tackle them with a solid plan, Test Driven Development and when needed joining up with other designers/developers.

**All or Parts. **While I do prefer working on projects from start to finish you can also hire me to add custom implementations like importing data from a database or to improve the performance of your existing website.
