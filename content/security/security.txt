## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have spotted a vulnerability in Kirby's core or the Panel, please make sure to let us know immediately. We take any report very seriously and we will react as soon as possible.

You can always write us directly at <support@getkirby.com>.

Please do *not* write to us publicly, e.g. in the forum, as making security vulnerabilities public before they are fixed can give attackers valuable time to exploit the issue. By letting us know directly, you can protect other Kirby users from such attacks.
