## About this Agreement
While Kirby's source code is publicly available, Kirby is **not free**. To use Kirby on a public server, you need to purchase a (link: buy text: license).

This End User License Agreement (the **"Agreement"**) is fundamental to the relationship between you and us. Therefore we recommend to read this Agreement carefully before you download, install or use Kirby.

If you do not agree to this Agreement, please do not download, install or use Kirby. Installation or use of Kirby signifies that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by this Agreement.

## Definitions
Before we get started with the conditions of the Agreement, let's define the terms that will be used throughout it:

- When we refer to **"You"**, we mean the licensee. Before purchasing Kirby, that's the individual or company that has downloaded and/or installed Kirby on a Development Machine. The licensee of a Public Site is the individual or company that has purchased the Kirby license. If you work on a client project and have purchased the Kirby license for your client, you (and *not* the client) are the licensee.
- When we refer to **"We"**/**"Us"**/**"Our"**, we mean the Bastian Allgeier GmbH. You can find our company and contact information on our (link: contact text: contact page).
- A **"Website"** is a single Kirby project that is defined by its domain name and root directory (e.g. `https://sub.example.com` or `https://example.com/example/`). Each (sub)domain and root directory is a separate Website, even if the projects are related in any way. If the same Kirby *multi-language installation* spans multiple domains, these domains count as the same Website.
- A **"Development Machine"** is a computer that is used to work on a Website (like a desktop PC, notebook or tablet). It can also be a server that is only accessible by a restricted number of users (like in an intranet or when protecting a staging website with a password that only a restricted number of users know).
- A **"Theme Demo"** is a Website with the single purpose to showcase a free or commercial Kirby theme, as long as that Website only contains demo content exactly as shipped with the theme.
- A **"Public Site"** is a Website that is installed on a computer/server that does *not* qualify as Development Machine and is *not* a Theme Demo.
- An **"Update"** is defined as a Kirby release which adds smaller new features, minor functionality enhancements or bug fixes. This class of release is identified by the change of the revision to the right of the first decimal point, e.g. 3.1 to 3.2 or 3.X.1 to 3.X.2.
- An **"Upgrade"** is a major Kirby release which incorporates major new features or enhancements that increase the core functionality of Kirby to a larger extent. This class of release is identified by the change of the revision to the left of the first decimal point, e.g. 3.X to 4.0. Whether a release is an Update or Upgrade is at Our sole discretion.
- The **"Source Code"** is defined as the contents of all files that are provided with Kirby and that make Kirby work. This includes (but is not limited to) all PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS files as well as all related image and other media files.

Every time you see one of these capitalized terms in the following text, it has the meaning that has been explained above.

## Usage for a Public Site
Installing Kirby on or using it for a Public Site requires a (link: buy text: paid license).

As Kirby is software and software is intangible, we don't sell it as such. Instead, this Agreement grants a license for each purchase to install and use a single instance of Kirby on a **specific Website**. Additional Kirby licenses must be purchased in order to install and use Kirby on **additional Websites**.

The license is **non-exclusive** (meaning that You are not the only one who We will issue a license) and **generally non-transferable** (meaning that the one who purchases the license is the licensee).

<info>
If you need to **transfer** your Kirby license to another individual or company, please get in touch directly at (email: support@getkirby.com).
</info>

A license is valid for all Updates of the same major Kirby release. We reserve the right to charge an **upgrade fee for Upgrade releases**.

## Free licenses
Kirby can be used **for free in the following cases**.

### Usage on a Development Machine
We believe that it should be possible to test and evaluate software before having to purchase a license. Also, we understand that a web project first needs to be built in a protected environment before it can be published.

Therefore, installing and using Kirby on a Development Machine is **free** for as long as You need. This includes permanent usage of Kirby in an intranet.

<info>
If you want to support our work, you can of course (link: buy text: purchase a voluntary license) for such a use-case. Thank you. <3

### Usage for a Theme Demo
Theme Demos are not real Websites. We want to encourage you to build and showcase your themes.

Therefore, You **don't need to register a license** for Theme Demos at all.

<info>
Please note that this does *not* apply to store fronts or other types of sites used to promote free or commercial themes. If such a site is built with Kirby as well, it is a Public Site and needs a **paid license** (see above).
