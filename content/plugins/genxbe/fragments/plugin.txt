Description: Kirby3 Fragments is a small string/translation helper. You can use fragments in your code 'laravel/blade' style and optionally translate them on site or page level. Additionaly you can pass placeholders to the fragment. A perfect solution for translation of static labels etc... But can also be used to make other 'static' content manageable via the CMS.
