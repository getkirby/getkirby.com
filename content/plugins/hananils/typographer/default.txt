Description: Typographer is a plugin for Kirby 3 to apply microtypographic rules to texts, setting opening and closing quotes (primary and secondary), apostrophes, primes, dashed, ellipses, multiplication and trademark signs. It understands the semantic of the given text, adjusting the typographic rules to the locale contextually.
