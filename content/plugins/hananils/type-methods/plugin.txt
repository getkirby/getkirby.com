Description: Type Methods is a plugin helping to identify the type of an object, either page, user or file, in order to simplify logic in snippets that – for instance – handle content from both $page and $user objects.

----

Example:

```php
$object->isPage();
$object->isUser();
$object->isFile();
$page->isType('article');
```
