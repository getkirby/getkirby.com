Description: Tree Methods converts field values to HTML and helps adapting the resulting markup by changing headline hierarchy, wrapping and filtering elements, manipulating tag names, add classes or other attributes. The main purpose of the plugin is to take the field markup, that usually is a static string returned by a formatter, and help web designers to tailor it the way they need it and to apply typographic tweaks.

Example:

```php
<?= $page->text()->toTree()->level(3) ?>
```
