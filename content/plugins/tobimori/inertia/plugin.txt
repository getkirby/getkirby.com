Title: Inertia Adapter

----

Text:

## What is Inertia.js?

Inertia is a new approach to building classic server-driven web apps. It works similar to the backend architecture for [Kirby's Panel](https://getkirby.com/releases/3.6/fiber) - but built with an ecosystem around it that works with Vue, React and Svelte.

Raw JSON data is returned from the server and rendered on the client-side. This allows you to build SPAs without having to build a separate API. Utilizing the server-side renderer, this makes perfect for websites that are heavily interactive but shouldn't suffer from SEO or performance issues.

## Usage

[Read the documentation](https://plugins.andkindness.com/inertia/docs/usage/what-is-inertia) to get started with Kirby and Inertia.
