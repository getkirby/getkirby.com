## Features

- 🪩 **Real-Time Preview**: See how your page looks before saving your changes and without leaving the Panel.
- ↪️ **Panel redirects**: Try navigating through the preview – if you click on a site link, such as in the header, the corresponding Panel page will open instead of the link in the preview.
- 🪠 **Sticky Column**: Edit your content side-by-side with the preview in a sticky column layout.
- 📡 **Detect Preview Mode**: You can conditionally hide elements, such as a cookie banner, or turn off animations in the rendered preview page.
