## Instant Demo

### Cookies

Like any Kirby website, the demo instances set a session cookie when you log in to the Panel.

You can read more about this in our (link: docs/guide/kirby-and-privacy text: privacy guide).

### IP address

Our demo manager software at https://demo.getkirby.com temporarily stores the IP address of the user who created the demo instance. We need it to protect against XSS attacks and to prevent the creation of too many demo instances per user.

Because the IP address is stored as a shortened hash only, we cannot convert it back to the actual IP address.

### Analytics and tracking

We **do not** use any trackers in the Instant Demo.

### TLS encryption

Like with our website, connections to the Instant Demo are always encrypted with TLS. See the section on our website's TLS encryption for more details.

We automatically collect and store information that your browser transmits to us in "server log files" on our Uberspace server. These are:

- Time of the server request
- IP address

This data will not be combined with data from other sources.
