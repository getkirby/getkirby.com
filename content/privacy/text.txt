### On this website

We don't collect any personal data of our website visitors except server logs. We use the following third parties to improve our website performance:

- KeyCDN:
*To speed up access to our site across the globe and to reduce the image file size*

In addition, we use YouTube and CARTO to display videos and maps with your consent.

If you voluntarily contribute website content such as plugin profiles, cookbook recipes or an entry on our community map, we use the personal data in such content for display on this website according to the respective purpose.

In our licensing hub we keep licensing information to enable license activations and upgrades and to check the license status of Kirby projects.

### Personal Demo

The Personal Demo you can access from the (link: try text: Try page) stores a shortened hash of your IP address to protect you against cross-site scripting attacks (known as XSS attacks) and to prevent the creation of too many demo instances per user.

The demo server temporarily stores content that you enter in your demo instance. This data is completely deleted when the demo instance expires or when you delete your instance manually.

Other personal data except server logs is not collected by the Personal Demo.

## Website

### License information

Our license hub at <https://hub.getkirby.com> keeps the information about Kirby licenses. We only store the information that is necessary to enable license activations and upgrades and to check the license status of Kirby projects. Specifically we store the customer's email address, the order number(s), the license type(s) and license code(s), the dates of purchase and first activation, the activated website domain(s) and upgrade status.

We collect this data during the checkout and activation processes. We delete the data as soon as it is no longer needed for the mentioned purposes (for example when a license is terminated).

The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.

### Contributed content

If you voluntarily contribute website content such as plugin profiles, cookbook recipes or an entry on our community map, we use the personal data in such content for display on this website according to the respective purpose.

We collect the content via clearly labeled forms on our website or via contributions to the website's source code. We delete your personal data on your request or as soon as the content is no longer relevant for its purpose.

The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR, which allows the processing of data with your consent.

## Personal Demo

### Cookies

Like any Kirby website, the demo instances set a session cookie when you log in to the Panel. You can read more about this in our (link: docs/guide/kirby-and-privacy text: privacy guide).

The demo server also sets a first-party cookie to remember your current demo instance to allow you to get back to your personal demo while it is active.

We **do not** set cookies for any other purpose.

The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract, in this case to ensure the functionality of the demo.

### IP address

Our demo manager software at https://trykirby.com temporarily stores the IP address of the user who created the demo instance. We need it to protect you against cross-site scripting attacks (known as XSS attacks) and to prevent the creation of too many demo instances per user.

Because the IP address is stored as a shortened hash only, we cannot convert it back to the actual IP address.

The IP address is collected during the creation of the demo instance and deleted when the demo instances expires or when you delete your instance manually.

The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, which allows the processing of data for the purposes of our legitimate interests, in this case to ensure network and information security.

### Content

The demo server temporarily stores content that you enter in your demo instance. This data is completely deleted when the demo instance expires or when you delete your instance manually.

The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract, in this case to ensure the functionality of the demo.

### Analytics and tracking

To ensure good performance of the demo, we use multiple server zones, currently in **Nuremberg, Germany** and **Hillsboro, USA**. When you create a new demo instance, your web browser automatically selects the server with the lowest latency – commonly the server physically closest to you.

We use the services of Ploi to manage our servers:

*Ploi
Amperestraat 16J, 3861NC
Nijkerk
Gelderland
The Netherlands*

Ploi complies with GDPR. You can find their privacy policy here: <https://ploi.io/privacy-policy>
