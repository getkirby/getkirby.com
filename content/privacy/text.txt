## Website

### Cookies

Our website **does not** set any cookies by default. Cookies are only set by the [shop](#shop) when visiting the "Buy" page or when using an affiliate link to visit our website.

### Analytics and tracking

We **do not** use any trackers, social media buttons or analytics services on our website.

### TLS encryption

This site uses TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential data. You can recognize an encrypted connection in your browser's address line when it changes from "http://" to "https://" and when the lock icon is displayed in your browser's address bar.

If TLS encryption is activated, the data you transfer to us cannot be read by third parties.

### Hosting

The server for our website is provided by

*Linode LLC
249 Arch Street
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19106
USA*

Linode complies with GDPR. The server is located in their data center in **Frankfurt, Germany**. You can find their privacy policy here: <https://www.linode.com/privacy>

### Server log files

We automatically collect and store information that your browser transmits to us in "server log files" on our Linode server. These are:

- Browser type and browser version
- Operating system used
- Referrer URL
- Host name of the accessing computer
- Time of the server request
- IP address

This data will not be combined with data from other sources.

The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.

### Third-party services

We use the following third-party services to improve the performance and usability of our site:

## Personal Demo

### Cookies

Like any Kirby website, the demo instances set a session cookie when you log in to the Panel.

You can read more about this in our (link: docs/guide/kirby-and-privacy text: privacy guide).

### IP address

Our demo manager software at https://trykirby.com temporarily stores the IP address of the user who created the demo instance. We need it to protect against XSS attacks and to prevent the creation of too many demo instances per user.

Because the IP address is stored as a shortened hash only, we cannot convert it back to the actual IP address.

### Content

The demo server temporarily stores content that you enter in your demo instance. This data is completely deleted when the demo instance expires or when you delete your instance manually.

### Analytics and tracking

We **do not** use any trackers in the Personal Demo.

### TLS encryption

Like with our website, connections to the Personal Demo are always encrypted with TLS. See the section on our website's TLS encryption for more details.

### Hosting

The server for the Personal Demo is provided by

*Linode LLC

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19106
USA*

Linode complies with GDPR. The server is located in their data center in **Frankfurt, Germany**. You can find their privacy policy here: <https://www.linode.com/privacy>

### Server log files

We automatically collect and store information that your browser transmits to us in "server log files" on our Linode server. These are:

- Browser type and browser version
- Operating system used
- Referrer URL
- Host name of the accessing computer
- Time of the server request
- IP address
- PHP errors that may occur in the demo

This data will not be combined with data from other sources.
