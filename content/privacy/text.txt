### Personal Demo

The Personal Demo you can access from the (link: try text: Try page) stores a shortened hash of your IP address to protect you against cross-site scripting attacks (known as XSS attacks) and to prevent the creation of too many demo instances per user.

The demo server temporarily stores content that you enter in your demo instance. This data is completely deleted when the demo instance expires or when you delete your instance manually.

Other personal data except server logs is not collected by the Personal Demo.

## Website

### License information

Our license hub at <https://hub.getkirby.com> keeps the information about Kirby licenses. We only store the information that is necessary to enable license activations and upgrades and to check the license status of Kirby projects. Specifically we store the customer's email address, the order number(s), the license type(s) and license code(s), the dates of purchase and first activation, the activated website domain(s) and upgrade status.

We collect this data during the checkout and activation processes. We delete the data as soon as it is no longer needed for the mentioned purposes (for example when a license is terminated).

The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.

### Contributed content

If you voluntarily contribute website content such as plugin profiles, cookbook recipes or an entry on our community map, we use the personal data in such content for display on this website according to the respective purpose.

We collect the content via clearly labeled forms on our website or via contributions to the website's source code. We delete your personal data on your request or as soon as the content is no longer relevant for its purpose.

The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR, which allows the processing of data with your consent.

### Cookies

Our website **does not** set any cookies by default. Cookies are only set as first-party cookies by the [shop](#shop) when visiting the "Buy" page or when using an affiliate link to visit our website.

The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, which allows the processing of data for the purposes of our legitimate interests, in this case to optimize the licensing experience.

### Analytics and tracking

We **do not** use any trackers, social media buttons or analytics services on our website.

### TLS transport encryption

This site uses TLS transport encryption to protect the transmission of sensitive data and prevent manipulation by eavesdroppers. You can recognize an encrypted connection in your browser's address line when it changes from "http://" to "https://" and when the lock icon is displayed in your browser's address bar.

If TLS transport encryption is activated, the data you transfer to us cannot be read by third parties.

### Hosting

The servers for our website are provided by:

*Hetzner Online GmbH
Industriestr. 25

## Personal Demo

### Cookies

Like any Kirby website, the demo instances set a session cookie when you log in to the Panel. You can read more about this in our (link: docs/guide/kirby-and-privacy text: privacy guide).

The demo server also sets a first-party cookie to remember your current demo instance to allow you to get back to your personal demo while it is active.

We **do not** set cookies for any other purpose.

The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract, in this case to ensure the functionality of the demo.

### IP address

Our demo manager software at https://trykirby.com temporarily stores the IP address of the user who created the demo instance. We need it to protect you against cross-site scripting attacks (known as XSS attacks) and to prevent the creation of too many demo instances per user.

Because the IP address is stored as a shortened hash only, we cannot convert it back to the actual IP address.

The IP address is collected during the creation of the demo instance and deleted when the demo instances expires or when you delete your instance manually.

The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, which allows the processing of data for the purposes of our legitimate interests, in this case to ensure network and information security.

### Content

The demo server temporarily stores content that you enter in your demo instance. This data is completely deleted when the demo instance expires or when you delete your instance manually.

The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract, in this case to ensure the functionality of the demo.

We use the services of Ploi to manage our servers:
