## 🧑‍💻 Disclaimers
(tabs…)
=== How to contribute?

We would love to get your feedback. Try out the alpha with a fresh Starterkit or locally with one of your projects. And help us find any bugs or regressions.

Have a look at the (link: #breaking-changes text: breaking changes). An important one: v5 will require PHP 8.2.

<warning>
We recommend to not use this alpha version in a production project.
</warning>

=== What to expect?

As we have (link: releases/4#versioning text: switched to a new versioning scheme) with Kirby 4, the next major release of Kirby will be v5 and is expected for the beginning of 2025. v5 behaves to v4 a lot more than e.g. 3.8 to 3.7. It won't be such a massive step as v3 to v4 and therefore even easier to upgrade.

We are sharing a the latest alpha with you. But please treat it for what it is: an alpha state. This means that this version is far from complete. More features will be added over the next few months, and other parts will change again.

=== And my license?

Kirby 5 will be a **free upgrade** for everyone with a Kirby Basic or Enterprise license for Kirby 4. Our new licenses include three years of major updates.

## 🎉 Features

<since v="5.0.0-alpha.1" label="Alpha 1">
### Dark theme: Turn off the Panel lights

As requested from many – whether as personal preference or for making the Panel more accessible with certain sight conditions – you are able to activate a dark theme for the Panel from your account view in v5. [#6299](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6299)

(image: dark-mode1.png)
(image: dark-mode2.png)
(image: dark-mode3.png)

We do expect to receive a lot of feedback on this feature and that the exact styling will be fine-tuned in the following pre-releases based on your feedback.

### View buttons: Put your own button up there

Kirby 5 adds new extensions that allow plugin developers to add custom view buttons to most views of the Panel (e.g. page, site, file, user, language). These buttons can be added alongside the default buttons, such as the preview button or settings dropdown button. [#6393](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6393)

(image: buttons.png)

There are different ways to define a custom button: in a blueprint, in the `config.php`, in a Panel area or as a full custom Vue component.

#### In a blueprint

To select which buttons to show on a particular view you can set the `buttons` option in the corresponding blueprint:

```yml "site/blueprints/pages/note.yml"
buttons:
  - preview
  - settings
```

This way, you can reference existing buttons by name and decide which ones to include and in what order.

#### A custom Vue component

Some custom buttons might need more options, more interactivity, more glamour than `<k-view-button>` offers. Those can create their own Vue component in your plugin's JavaScript file:

```js "site/plugins/your-plugin/index.js"
panel.plugin("getkirby/custom-view-buttons", {
  viewButtons: {
    applause: {
      template: `<k-button icon="heart" variant="filled" theme="love" size="sm" @click="applause">Applause</k-button>`,
      methods: {
        applause() {
          alert("👏");
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

You can then reference it by name in your blueprints or config file. Or if you want to pass props as well:

```yml
buttons:
  - preview
  - settings
  - applause
```
</since>

<since v="5.0.0-alpha.2" label="Alpha 2">
### Bring out the big files: Chunked uploads

Kirby 5 supports large Panel uploads. Uploads are no longer restricted by the server's `upload_max_filesize` limit but instead uploaded in chunks that are pieced back together on the server.

If you want to keep restricting the upload size to some limits, the file blueprint (link: docs/reference/panel/blueprints/file#accept text: `accept` `maxsize` option) is your friend.

(video: chunked.mp4 controls: true autoplay: true loop: true class: video rounded shadow-xl bg-light)

### Even Better View buttons

Building upon the foundation from Alpha 1, you can now also define new custom buttons directly in your blueprints:

```yml
buttons:
  - preview
  - settings
  myBytton:
    text: My Button
    link: https://getkirby.com
    theme: positive
```

You can also pass custom Vue component and its props.

```yml
buttons:
  - preview
  - settings
  applause:
    component: k-applause-view-button
    props:
      foo: bar
```

The available options are based on the (link: https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/blob/v5/develop/panel/src/components/View/Buttons/Button.vue text: `k-view-button` component) (better docs will follow until the final release).

#### In the `config.php`

Similarly to the blueprints, buttons can now be defined in your config file. In this case, not for a specific template but in general for the different view types (page, file, site, user, system, ...):

```php "site/config/config.php"
'panel' => [
  'viewButtons' => [
    'site' => [
      'preview',
      'a' => [
        'icon'   => 'heart',
        'text'   => 'Kosmos',
        'theme'  => 'purple-icon',
        'target' => '_blank',
        'link'   => 'https://getkirby.com'
      ],
      'b-dropdown' => [
        'props' => [
          'icon'     => 'info',
          'text'     => 'Info',
          'dropdown' => 'my/dropdown/route'
        ]
      ],
      'c-component' => [
        'component' => 'my-custom-component',
        'props' => [
          'foo' => 'bar'
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
]
```

What you can see above are three different ways to define a custom button:
- The first one directly defines the options. It's a shortcut that assumes these are the props for the `k-view-button` component.
- In the second example, they are already wrapped inside the `props` key. But no `component` is defined, so `k-view-button` is used as well.
- In the third example, we actually define a custom Vue component that should be used instead, alongside passing props to this component.

#### In a Panel area

If you do not want to define just one button via the config, but reuse it (or even ship it as part of your plugin), you can add them to the Panel area extension:

```php "site/plugins/your-plugin/index.php"
Kirby::plugin('custom/buttons', [
  'areas' => [
    'todos' => function () {
      return [
        'buttons' => [
          'todos.add' => function () {
            return [
              'props' => [
                'icon'   => 'add',
                'dialog' => 'todos/create'
              ]
            ];
          }
        ]
      ];
    }
  ]
]);
```

You have the same options for your return  value: full `component`-`props` array or just props on top-level. In addition, you can also return directly a `Kirby\Panel\Ui\Button\ViewButton` object.
</since>

<since v="5.0.0-alpha.3" label="Alpha 3">
### File previews: Your media at a glance

With Kirby 5, we're opening up the preview part of the Panel's file view to more rich media previews that aren't just images.

It starts with basic previews for video and audio files that now ship as part of the core:

(image: file-preview-video.png)
(image: file-preview-audio.png)

But you can also add custom file previews as plugin extensions to customize the preview for these formats or create previews for other file formats.

Custom file previews consist of two parts:
- a PHP class defining what data is passed to the preview and what files this preview is used for
- a Vue component to render the preview

#### Custom `FieldPreview` class

For a custom file preview, you need a new class that extends `Kirby\Panel\Ui\FieldPreview`. In this example, we're building a custom preview for `.glb` files that are used to display 3D data:

```php
class GlbFilePreview extends FilePreview
{
  public function __construct(
    public File $file,
    public string $component = 'k-glb-file-preview'
  ) {
  }

  public static function accepts(File $file): bool
  {
    return $file->extension() === 'glb';
  }
}
```

This is the minimal setup for a custom class. What it does:
- It defines which Vue component to use, in this case `k-glb-file-preview` which we will create later. If no component is specified, `k-default-file-preview` will be used.
- Something you must define is the `::accepts($file)` method. It is used to determine which preview class is used for a certain file. Kirby will loop through all available preview classes and use the first one that accepts the file.


#### Register your preview class

To use your custom file preview class, you need to register it as a plugin extension:

```php
Kirby::plugin('your/plugin', [
  'filePreviews' => [
    GlbFilePreview::class
  ]
]);
```

#### Vue component

Finally, we need to create the Vue component that is used to render the preview. As above listed, we have named it `k-glb-file-preview`.

By default, file preview components will receive three default props:
- `url` to the file
- `details` array with basic file information (ideally used for `<k-file-preview-details>`)
- `image` object with the thumb icon/image also used in sections etc. (we don't use it for this preview)

We also use the `<k-file-preview-frame>` component as wrapper for our actual 3D model, which adds a pattern background.

```js
panel.plugin("getkirby/custom-file-preview", {
  components: {
    "k-glb-file-preview": {
      template: `
        <figure class="k-default-file-preview k-glb-file-preview">
          <k-file-preview-frame>
            <model-viewer :src="url" />
          </k-file-preview-frame>

          <k-file-preview-details :details="details" />
        </figure>
      `,
      props: {
        details: Array,
        url: String,
      },
    },
  }
});
```

The `<model-viewer>` element is [from a library](https://modelviewer.dev) that helps to actually display the GLB file. I won't go into the details how to use it exactly (loading external script etc.). You can try the (link: https://github.com/getkirby/sandbox/pull/7 text: full custom file view).

<since v="5.0.0-alpha.4" label="Alpha 4">

### Versions: Preview your changes

We are finally able to release a big foundational part for one of the (link: https://feedback.getkirby.com/135 text: most requested features) on our feedback platform. Editors can now make changes and get a full, rendered preview right from the Panel before they save them. They can share the URL for the preview of the unpublished changes with other editors and people in their team to get feedback.

The brand new changes view lets you switch between a comparison mode or a full-width preview of the changed version and the latest published version.

(video: changes.mp4 controls: true autoplay: true class: video rounded shadow-xl bg-light)

The new preview view for pages and the site is located at `/panel/pages/(:any)/changes/(changes|latest|compare)` and `/panel/site/changes/(changes|latest|compare)`.

It can be accessed with the new preview dropdown for the site and pages.

(image: preview-dropdown.png class: screenshot-sm)

… or through the page context menu …

(image: page-menu.png class: screenshot-sm)

Get more details about the changes for the current page, file or user, by accessing the new info dropdown next to the form buttons:

(image: changes-info-dropdown.png class: screenshot-sm)

This dropdown will also show more information when the content is locked because another editor is currently working on it.

(image: changes-info-dropdown-locked.png class: screenshot-sm)

All changes by everyone in the team - not just the current editor - are now listed in the Changes dialog (accessible via the “Changes” menu item in the sidebar) and grouped by type (page, user, file). Now everyone in the team can directly use the dialog to jump to changes by other team members and preview them directly on the fly, even while someone else is still actively working on them.

(image: changes-dialog.png class: screenshot-md)

We’ve also improved the language dropdown to highlight changes in different translations.

(image: languages-dropdown.png class: screenshot-sm)

With all of those features built on top of our new content version architecture, Kirby 5 starts a path to full revision support in the future. We have already laid the foundations and are looking forward to extending the feature set over time.

<alert>
Kirby 5 alpha 4 does not cover all special cases in regards to the handling of unsaved changes yet. For example it can not yet handle or migrate existing unsaved changes in the `localStorage` of individual editors' browsers that were created in Kirby 4 or Kirby 5 alphas 1 to 3. This fine-tuning will follow in future pre-releases. So we again recommend not to use Kirby 5 in production already, especially if any of the site's content currently has any unsaved changes.
</alert>

### New Plugin License handling

Plugin licenses are now shown in the plugins table with an additional icon and theme to indicate their status. Licenses can now have an additional link to their license document or a custom license shop. [#6738](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6738)

(image: plugin-licenses.png)

- New `Kirby\Plugin\License` class
- New `Kirby\Plugin\LicenseStatus` class
- New `k-table-license-cell` component in the system view

**Defining a plugin license as simple array**

This is great if you want to point to your own license document.

```php
App::plugin(
  name: 'my/plugin',
  extends: [...],
  license: [
    'name' => 'Custom license',
    'link' => '<https://mylicenseshop.com>',
    'status' => 'active',
  ]
);
```

**Setting a custom status**

```php
App::plugin(
  name: 'my/plugin',
  extends: [...],
  license: [
    'name' => 'Custom license',
    'link' => 'https://mylicenseshop.com',
    'status' => [
      'value' => 'missing',
      'theme' => 'negative',
      'label' => 'Get a license please',
      'icon' => 'alert'
    ]
  ]
);
```

**A Custom license for your plugin**

You can also pass a license object. Extend our `Kirby\Plugin\License` class to return a custom status, them, icon and label, depending on the state of your plugin’s license. This is great if you are working with a proprietary license for your plugin, which might still need to purchased/activated by the user.

```php
use Kirby\Plugin\License;
use Kirby\Plugin\LicenseStatus;
use Kirby\Plugin\Plugin;

class MyCustomLicense extends License
{
  public function __construct(
    protected Plugin $plugin
  ){
    $this->name = 'My Custom License';
    $this->link = '<https://mylicenseshop.com>';
    $this->status = LicenseStatus(
      value: 'missing',
      theme: 'negative',
      label: 'Get a license please',
      icon: 'alert'
    )
  }
}

App::plugin(
  name: 'my/plugin',
  extends: [...],
  license: function (Plugin $plugin) {
    return new MyCustomLicense($plugin)
  }
);
```

### New Redis Cache Driver

Redis is one of the most used cache types. We’ve added a brand new Redis cache driver to the core. You can now use it out of the box by setting up the Redis server connection in your config. [#6736](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6736)

```php
<?php

return [
    'cache' => [
        'pages' => [
            'active' => true,
            'type'   => 'redis',
            'host'   => '127.0.0.1', // default host address
            'port'   => 6379, // default port number
            'auth'   => ['user', 'password'], // optional
        ]
    ]
];
```

  ```php
  // examples
  $page->lock()->isLocked()
  $page->lock()->modified()
  $page->lock()->modified('d.m.Y')
  $page->lock()->user()?->username()
  ```

- New third `$fail` argument for `Data::read()` and `Data::decode()`. By default, `Data::read()` and `Data::decode()` will throw an exception if the file does not exist or the data cannot be decoded. By setting `$fail` to false, you can block the exception and return an empty array instead. We’ve refactored our parts of the code where we used a try/catch block to achieve the same.

  ```php
  use Kirby\Data\Data;

  $data = Data::read(__DIR__ . '/missing-file.yml', fail: false);
  $data = Data::decode($brokenData, type: 'json', fail: false);
  ```

- New `$pretty` argument for `Json::encode()`

  ```php
  use Kirby\Data\Json;

  $prettyJson = Json::encode($data, pretty: true);
  ```

- New `Kirby\Content\Changes` class replaces `Kirby\Cms\ContentLocks` to track all unsaved changes across all users and models. This class is mostly internal, but you can use it to get access to changed pages, files and users on the backend.

  ```php
  use Kirby\Content\Changes;

  $changes = new Changes();

  // collection of changed pages
  $changes->pages();
  // collection of changed files
  $changes->files();
  // collection of changed users
  $changes->users();
  ```

- New default `changes` cache, which is active by default. This cache is internally used to store all changes that have not been published yet. You can change the cache settings in your config:

  ```php
  // /site/config/config.php
  return [
      'cache' => [
          'changes' => [
              'type' => 'redis'
          ]
      ]
  ];
  ```

- New `Language::ensure()` and `Languages::ensure()` methods to get language(s) objects even in single-language mode. Note that these methods are marked as internal and may be changed in a future version. [#6483](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6483)

  ```php
  use Kirby\Cms\Language;
  use Kirby\Cms\Languages;

  // for a single language
  echo Language::ensure('default')->code();

  // for all languages
  foreach (Languages::ensure() as $language) {
    echo $language->code();
  }
  ```

## 🚨 Breaking changes

<since v="5.0.0-alpha.1" label="Alpha 1">
- Kirby requires at least PHP 8.2
- Data/variables from your `site` controller will now be passed to all templates [#6412](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6412)
- PHP (return) type hints have been added to many collection methods. If you are extending any collection classes, you might need to add the same to your methods.
- CSS attribute selectors must be written fully qualified (e.g. `[data-hidden="true"]` as only `[data-hidden]` can start matching also elements where that attribute is `false`) [#6109](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6109)
- While `<k-writer>` is still included as alias for <`k-writer-input`>, some use cases where you accessed the `<k-writer>` component via the `$refs` of `<k-writer-input>` have to be adapted [#6172](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6172)
- Select field: `empty` prop was removed. Use combination of `required`, `placeholder` and `default` to replicate functionality [#6459](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6459)
- `<k-draggable>`: the `move` callback function is receiving an event with an altered data structure
- `<k-form>` and `<k-fieldset>` as well as many fields and inputs don't emit an `invalid` event anymore. Use native HTML invalid state of elements instead. [#6099](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6099)
- `novalidate` prop has been removed from all elements but `<k-form>` [#6099](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6099)
- Removed `hasErorrs` methods of `k-fieldset` [#6173](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6173)
- `Str::camel()`, `Str::camelToKebab()`, `Str::float()`, `Str::kebab()`, `Str::kebabToCamel()`, `Str::length()`, `Str::lower()`, `Str::safeTemplate()`, `Str::short()`, `Str::slug()`, `Str::snake()`, `Str::studly()`, `Str::substr()`, `Str::template()`, `Str::ucfirst()`, `Str::ucwords()`, `Str::unhtml()`, `Str::upper()` and `Str::widont()` can no longer be called without a value argument (passing a `null` value still works) [#6401](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6401)
- All content storage methods must now use the `VersionId` instead of a simple string. [#6436](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6436)
</since>

<since v="5.0.0-alpha.2" label="Alpha 2">

    - Safari 16+
    - Mobile Safari 16+
    - Android Browser 126+
    - Chrome for Android 126+
- If file sorting was previously disabled via the `files.update` permission, the new `file.sort` permission has to be configured accordingly. [#6589](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6589)
- Panel uploads can exceed the `upload_max_filesize` limit [#6421](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6421)
    - If you want to restrict the upload size, please use the file blueprint (link: docs/reference/panel/blueprints/file#accept text: `accept` `maxsize` option)
- Increased PHP type hinting: when you're extending core classes, you might have to add the same type hints to your code as added to our core classes.
- `Image\Dimensions::forImage()` now receives an `Image\Image` object [#6591](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6591)

</since>

<since v="5.0.0-alpha.3" label="Alpha 3">
- Model action `before` hooks: rules get applied after the hook runs
- `<k-file-preview>` got fully refactored. If you were replacing or extending it, your code likely will break. Check out the new custom file preview feature if you want to provide previews for specific files. [#6578](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6578)
- Calendar dropdown input will show Sunday now as first day of the week (depending on the user's language). If you want to enforce Monday as first day of the week, you can set the `date.weekday` option to `1`. [#6635](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6635)
- All methods in `*Rules` classes are now marked to return void instead of a boolean [#6660](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6660)

- `Site::changes` is now a new method to track changes across the site. The `changes` field is used as a storage for those changes and has thus become a reserved field for Kirby.
- All methods in `*Rules` classes are now marked to return void instead of a boolean [#6660](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6660)
</since>

<since v="5.0.0-alpha.4" label="Alpha 4">
### Panel

- Vuex and the Vuex content module have been removed.
- The following dialogs no longer send dispatch events via the backend. Dispatch events relied on Vuex.
    - `page.changeTitle`
    - `page.delete`
    - `page.move`
    - `user.delete`

### Api

- Removed API routes:
    - `GET`: `/api/(:all)/lock`
    - `PATCH`: `/api/(:all)/lock`
    - `DELETE`: `/api/(:all)/lock`
    - `PATCH`: `/api/(:all)/unlock`
    - `DELETE`: `/api/(:all)/unlock`

### Translations

- `signature` is longer available as field property when loading fields from the Panel backend [#6712](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6712)
- `Kirby\Plugin\Plugin::license()` now returns the License object instead of a simple string
- `Kirby\Plugin\Plugin::toArray()` includes the full license info as child array instead of a string
- `ModelWithContent::version()` is now a reserved keyword. If you've used a field with this name, you need to use `$model->content()->get('version')` instead to work with the field.
- `ModelWithContent::lock()` will now always return a `Kirby\Content\Lock` object, even if the model is not currently locked. You can check for that case with `ModelWithContent::lock()->isLocked()`
- Removed `Kirby\Cms\ContentLock` and `Kirby\Cms\ContentLocks` as well as `Kirby\Cms\App::locks()`
- `Page::modified()`, `File::modifiedContent()` and `User::modified()` now use the current language instead of the default language.

- `Kirby\Form\Field::$formFields` has been renamed to `Kirby\Form\Field::$siblings`
- The `$formField` argument in `Kirby\Form\Field::factory()` has been renamed to `$siblings`
- You can no longer pass a value to `Kirby\Form\Field::isEmpty()` Use `Kirby\Form\Field::isEmptyValue($value)` instead.

- The `<k-user-profile>` component has been refactored to use individual props for `api`, `avatar`, `email`, `id`, `language` and `role` instead of going through the `model` object. The `model` object prop has been removed as well as the already deprecated `permissions` prop.
- Drastically simplified `Kirby\Panel\ChangesDialog` class, which reads changed models directly on the backend with the new `Kirby\Content\Changes` class and sends the required data for each model directly to the frontend. We no longer need an additional async request.
- Refactored `Kirby\Panel\Model` classes
    - Removed `Kirby\Panel\Model::lock()` method
    - New `Kirby\Panel\Model::originals()` method

        	  'text' => [
        	    'label' => 'Text',
        	    'type'  => 'text'
        		]
        	],

        );
        ```
    - New `Fields::defaults()` method to return all default values for all fields.
    - New `Fields::errors()` method to run validation on all fields and return an array with all errors
    - New `Fields::fill($values)` method to set the value for each field in the array
    - New `Fields::findByKey()` and `Fields::findByKeyRecursive()` to find fields within fields with `Fields::find('parent-field+child-field')` (e.g. a field in a structure field) This has been handled by the `Form::field()` method before, but it's the wrong place to do that. With the new collection methods, this is handled in a very similar fashion as we do for pages.
    - Improved `Fields::toArray()` method. You can now provide a proper map function to return custom values for each field in the collection.
    - New `Fields::toFormValues()` to return all values for all fields in the collection that can be passed to a frontend form.
    - New `Fields::toStoredValues()` to return all values for all fields in a format that can be stored in our text files.
- `Kirby\Form\Form` class improvements
    - The Form class now always passes the injected model to the Fields collection
    - The Form class now uses `Field::isSaveable` instead of `Field::save` consistently.
    - `Form::errors()` is now an alias for `$form->fields()->errors()`
    - `Form::field($name)` is now an alias for `$form->fields()->find($name)`
    - New `Form::toFormValues()` to return all values for all fields in the collection that can be passed to a frontend form.
    - New `Form::toStoredValues()` to return all values for all fields in a format that can be stored in our text files.
    - Removed an unnecessary check for a blueprint method in the `Form::for` method. ModelWithContent has a blueprint method by default and we
    already check for ModelWithContent child classes with the argument type.
- New Form Field Trait classes to help reduced code redundancy between `Kirby\Form\Field` and `Kirby\Form\FieldClass`
    - `Kirby\Form\Mixin\Api`
    - `Kirby\Form\Mixin\Model`
    - `Kirby\Form\Mixin\Translatable`
    - `Kirby\Form\Mixin\Validation`
    - `Kirby\Form\Mixin\Value`
    - `Kirby\Form\Mixin\When`

### Additional core refactoring

- New `Kirby\Plugin` namespace [#6737](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6737)
- New `Kirby\Toolkit\Component::applyProp()` method to allow resetting single props and also improves prop unsetting in custom components.
