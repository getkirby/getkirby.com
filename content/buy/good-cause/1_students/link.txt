Text:

Students and academic staff members can receive a free Kirby license, upon verification of their school/college/university domain email address or student ID card. The license must *not* be used for other than personal and/or teaching projects.

This also applies to universities, colleges or schools who want to use Kirby in the classroom or for student-related educational projects.

<info>
For classroom use (in a course or workshop), we are happy to provide a free license for each student. Please send us a list of student email addresses so we can create the licenses in bulk (please ensure consent of your students) or ask the students to get in contact directly.
