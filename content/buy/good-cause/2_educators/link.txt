Text:

Academic staff members can receive a free Kirby license, upon verification of their school/college/university domain email address or upon providing other proof of their teaching role.

The license must *not* be used for anything other than teaching projects.

This also applies to universities, colleges or schools who want to use Kirby in the classroom or for student-related educational projects.

<info>
For classroom use (in a course or workshop), we are happy to provide a free license for each student. Please send us a list of student email addresses so we can create the licenses in bulk (please ensure consent of your students) or ask the students to get in contact directly.
