text:

## Overview

We will enforce this code throughout the duration of the conference, including but not limited to sessions, parties, fringe events, Slack channels, Twitter, and other online communities. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants (including but not limited to attendees, speakers, sponsors, and staff members) in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including sessions, parties, fringe events, Slack channels, Twitter and other online media. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from all events without a refund at the discretion of the event organisers.

## Our Policy

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, unwanted photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Staff should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from all events with no refund.

## Need help?

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of event staff immediately. If you would feel more comfortable speaking to a specific person, please contact our designated Code of Conduct staff members noted below. We understand that some people will be more comfortable discussing such sensitive issues via written communication instead of face-to-face, so please feel free to get in touch via e-mail or send us a direct message on Twitter:

We will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at the conference venue and conference-related social events.
