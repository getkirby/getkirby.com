Title: Template

----
Entry:

Templates are `.php` files that render the (glossary: content text: content) of your pages. They contain the HTML for the page together with some PHP control structures. They may also contain logic, but we recommend the use of (glossary: controller text: controllers) for more complex logic. Templates are stored in `/site/templates`.
