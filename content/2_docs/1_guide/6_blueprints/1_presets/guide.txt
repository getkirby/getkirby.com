## Available Presets

Kirby ships with the following presets that you can use to get started. For fully customized layouts check out our (link: docs/guide/blueprints/layout text: layout guide).

### Page

For a typical single page setup (articles, projects, text pages, etc.), you can use the `page` preset.

```yaml
title: Simple Page
preset: page
fields:
    headline:
        label: Headline
        type: text
    text:
        label: Text
        type: textarea
```

This preset will automatically set up the form fields and a sidebar with subpages and files.

Besides defining form fields, you can also control the files and pages settings with this preset. (link: docs/reference/panel/presets/page text: Learn more…)

<info>
The `page` preset is very close to Kirby 2 blueprints and the perfect starting point if you want to migrate an old project.

### Pages

A collection of pages, such as a blog, projects or a shop, often don't really need form fields or files, but more features to manage subpages. The `pages` preset is perfect for such page types.

```yaml
title: Blog
preset: pages
```

You have a lot of additional options to configure the way subpages are displayed and which templates are allowed. (link: docs/reference/panel/presets/pages text: Learn more…)

### Files

Some page types, such as photo albums, should focus entirely on the file management. That's what the `files` preset is made for.

```yaml
title: Gallery
preset: files
```

The `files` preset can do a lot more to set up the ratio, size, image cropping and info of each card. (link: docs/reference/panel/presets/files text: Learn more…)
