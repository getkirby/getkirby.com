Title: Translating URLs

----

Description: Learn how to translate the URLs for pages in all available languages.

Text:

Kirby helps you to create nice URLs for all your pages.

```
http://yourdomain.com/projects/project-a
```

Such URLs are readable for your visitors as well as for search engines.

But when working with a multi-language site project, you will be facing the problem that those URLs should somehow be translatable.

```
http://yourdomain.com/projekte/projekt-a
```

When multiple languages are configured for your site, you can add an additional `slug` field to translated content files to translate the foldername of a page.

Here's a quick example – English is the default language:

```kirbycontent "content/projects/projects.en.txt"
  Title: My Title
  ----
  Text: This is the text for the projects page
```

```kirbycontent "content/projects/projects.de.txt"
  Title: Mein Titel
  ----
  Slug: projekte
  ----
  Text: Das ist der Text für die Projekt Seite
```

The URL for the English version will be:

```
http://yourdomain.com/en/projects
```

and the URL for the German translation will be:

```
http://yourdomain.com/de/projekte
```

You don't have to add the `slug` field to your text files for your default language. Kirby will use the folder name in that case.
