## Values for `$args`

`$args` can be a string, `true`, `false` or a combination of a filter method and an argument. In case of the `in` or `not in` filters, the third argument must be an array.


## Examples

```php
// filter by extension
$images = $page->images()->filterBy('extension', 'jpg');

// filter by custom field value
$images = $page->images()->filterBy('gallery', 'gallery-2');

// filter by filenames containing a string
$files = $page->files()->filterBy('filename', '*=', '-document');

// filter all types except documents
$files = $page->files()->filterBy('type', '!=', 'document');

// filter all files that have a template assigned
$files = $page->files()->filterBy('template', true);
```

## Available filter methods

-        | -

in       | takes an array as parameter, matches all values that are included in the array
!=       | all values that don't match
not in   | takes an array as parameter, matches all values that are not included in the array
