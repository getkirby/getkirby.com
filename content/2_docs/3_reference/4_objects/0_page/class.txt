## How to fetch the `$page` object

The `$page` class is available in Kirby's templates/snippets etc. through the `$page` variable that -  unless otherwise defined â€“ always refers to the current page.

However, you can also define a `$page` object by calling a specific page using the `page()` helper:

```php
$page = page('somepage');
```

Or getting it from a collection of pages

```php
$page = $pages->first();
```

<info>
When getting a specific page via the [`page()` helper](/docs/reference/templates/helpers/page) or when trying to create a page object from field values stored in content, always verify that you have a page object before you call any of the Page methods.

## Examples

With the `$page` object defined, you can start using the methods of the class:

### Get a field of the page

```php
<?= $page->title() ?>
```

### Get the children of the page

```php
<?php $children = $page->children() ?>
```

### Get all images of the page

```php
<?php $images = $page->images() ?>
```

### Check if the page is active

```php
<?php e($page->isActive(), 'active') ?>
```

### Check if the page has draft children

```php
if ($page->hasDrafts()) {
  echo "This page still has some children that haven't been published yet";
}
```
