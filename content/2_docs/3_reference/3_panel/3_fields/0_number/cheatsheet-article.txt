Title: Number

Excerpt:

A number input field with validation

----

Text:

The number field generates an HTML 5 number input, which is great when you need a comfortable way to enter any numeric values. The number field also comes with built-in validation for numeric data.

## Example

```yaml
fields:
  number:
    label: Number
    type: number
```

## Blueprint

(field-options: number)

## Decimals

Decimals can be used by adding the `step` option.

```yaml
fields:
  price:
    label: Price
    type: number
    step: .01
```

## Minimum and maximum value

The `min` and `max` options define which numbers can be selected with the browser-specific up/down arrows and are also used to validate the input.

```yaml
fields:
  temperature:
    label: Temperature
    type: number
    min: -50
    max: 250
```

## `before` & `after` values

The number field can show additional text before or after the input. This is great when you need a price field for example:

```yaml
fields:
  price:
    label: Price
    type: number
    min: 0
    before: â‚¬
```
