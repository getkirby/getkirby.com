Text:

The hidden field makes it possible to keep fields in content files without actually making them editable or even visible in Panel forms.

## Example

```yaml
fields:
  title:
    label: Title
    type: title
  text:
    label: Text
    type: textarea
  notes:
    type: hidden
```

This can be useful to store additional information for a page, which is only available to the developer or editors who have access to the filesystem.
