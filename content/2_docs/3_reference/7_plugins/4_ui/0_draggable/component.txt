Title: Draggable
----
Text:

The Draggable component implements the [Vue.Draggable](https://github.com/SortableJS/Vue.Draggable) library which is a wrapper for the widespread [Sortable.js](https://github.com/RubaXa/Sortable) library.

```html
<k-draggable>
  <li>Drag me.</li>
  <li>Or me.</li>
  <li>Drop it!</li>
</k-draggable>
```

Please find all documentation regarding the possibilities over on the [Vue.Draggable](https://github.com/SortableJS/Vue.Draggable) documentation. Whenever you read `<draggable>` there, think `<k-draggable>`.
