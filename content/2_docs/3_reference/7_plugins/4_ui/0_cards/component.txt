Title: Cards
----
Text:

The Cards component builds a very responsive grid of cards from the given cards option or by injecting cards into the default slot.

## Cards Option

```html
<k-cards
  :cards="[
    {...},
    {...},
    {...},
  ]"
/>
```

Check out the [Card component](./card) documentation for all available options for each card.

## Default Slot

If you need more control over each card, you can inject cards manually

```html
<k-cards>
  <k-card v-bind="..." />
  <k-card v-bind="..." />
  <k-card v-bind="..." />
  <k-card v-bind="..." />
</k-cards>
```
