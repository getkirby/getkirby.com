Title: Meetups

----

Description: Connect with other Kirby developers around the world or meet face-to-face at a local meetup.

----

Howto:

1. **It doesn't have to be anything big:** a small get-together at the local pub or an event in an agency's office. What matters is to meet like-minded people. Start small.
3. **Think about how to spend your time.** What do you prefer? Just chatting with other developers about Kirby, work and life? Sharing lessons learned from projects in short presentations?
4. **Spread the word.** Let the community know about your event. (email: mail@getkirby.com text: Send us an email) or share it on (link: https://chat.getkirby.com text: Discord class: link) and we will help you promote it.
5. **Take photos.** Not a must, and nobody should be forced to do so. Of course, we'd love to see some snaps of your meetings, if everyone feels comfortable with it.
