Title: Meetups

----

Description: Connect with other Kirby developers around the world or meet face-to-face at a local meetup.

----

Howto:

1. **It doesn't need to be big:** whether a small get-together at the local pub or hosting in the office of an agency. What counts is to get together with likeminded people. Start small.
2. **Think about how to spend the time.** What do you prefer? Just chatting with other developers about Kirby, work and life? Sharing lessons learned from projects in short presentations?
3. **Spread the word.** Let the community know about your event. (email: mail@getkirby.com text: Send us an email) or share it on (link: https://chat.getkirby.com text: Discord class: link) and we will help promote it.
4. **Take photos.** Not a must and nobody who doesn't like it should be forced to. We really love to see some snaps when people from the community get together. If everyone feels comfortable with it, let us see your happy faces.
