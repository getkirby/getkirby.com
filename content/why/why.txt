Developers:

- headline: Keeping it simple
  text: Kirby's architecture is built with simplicity and flexibility in mind. Download it, put it in the web root of your server and go.  With Kirby, you start to be efficient in minutes.
- headline: Flexible
  text: We love LEGO and Kirby is like digital LEGO. With our PHP API, you can fetch any type of content or file, filter, modify and combine data and create anything that your project requires. If you can dream it, you can probably build it with Kirby. Whenever you hit a road-block, you can be pretty sure that there's a way to extend the system with a plugin and the forum will always be there for you to help you with new ideas.
- headline: Runs on almost anything
  text: Kirby is happy as long as there's PHP 7.1+ and a web server. You don't need tons of RAM, disk space, lots of PHP extensions or a database server. Pretty much any cheap shared hosting will do. This is great to experiment in a low-cost environment, but it's also liberating in client projects when your clients already have some unpleasant hosting plan lying around.
- headline: It's fast
  text: Kirby is fast by default. Our Starterkit pages render in between 30ms - 70ms (running on Valet+ on macOS) without caching enabled. With SSD hosting becoming an industry standard, Kirby installations often have a huge performance benefit compared to other database-driven systems or even our file-based competitors. If this is not enough, we have a powerful caching engine that can be switched from files to APCu, memcached or your own favorite cache engine.
- headline: Fewer dependencies = less trouble
  text: We love to keep things simple. That’s why we built Kirby on top of our own micro framework that focuses on providing what we need for Kirby. With this setup, we can bring you all those amazing features at a bundle size of just ~3MB, including the Panel. This ensures better performance and less bloat. You can keep it vanilla or bring your own framework or PHP libraries of choice without feeling bad about it.
- headline: Your templates
  text: Kirby's default template engine is built around PHP and HTML. It's extremely fast and with our object-oriented, chainable PHP API, it's also very powerful. But Kirby 3 is in fact template engine agnostic. If you prefer Twig, Blade or any other engine, you can replace ours. There are plugins for Twig and Blade and it's possible to build your own.
- headline: Headless option
  text: Bring your own frontend, SPA or mobile application in combination with our headless API. Use the full power of our Panel and publish projects to any imaginable destination.
- headline: Secure
  text: Kirby 3 is built on a modern, secure stack with PHP 7.1+ and Vue.js at its core. Our file-based architecture solves a lot of the typical security issues of modern CMS systems by eliminating the database and all connected SQL injections. We follow OWASP standards closely and only had a handful vulnerability reports in the last 7 years. We provide security patches within a day in such cases.
- headline: Extensive documentation
  text: We spend a lot of time writing documentation for every aspect of Kirby. Get started with our guide, take a deep dive into every tiny detail with our reference or learn about all kinds of solutions in our cookbook.
- headline: A wonderful community
  text: You are never alone with your problems. Our friendly community has evolved into a great family of professional designers and developers over the years and we are always here to help you out.

Designers:

- headline: Built for your content
  text: Kirby's admin interface is the perfect platform for your content. With a design as reduced as possible, Kirby puts the focus on your images, your videos, your articles, etc., providing timeless simplicity–not brutal branding.
- headline: A philosophy of minimalism
  text: Our philosophy at Kirby is to start as lean as possible and to create a powerful set of LEGO bricks for you. With Kirby you add the things you need in a project instead of having to remove tons of unwanted features and plugins to get started.
- headline: Your design, your markup
  text: Kirby makes no assumptions about the way you design your site, nor does it impose anything on you, no frameworks, no widgets… Each Kirby site is 100% yours. With our incredibly flexible template system you start with a minimal layout and get very detailed with the individual design for any type of page.
- headline: Be the admin interface designer
  text: You can customize our admin panel to the very last bit, and put as much care into the editing experience as you put into the design of the frontend. Combine interface elements and features in a way that reflects your design intentions and content requirements in the best possible way.
- headline: Be part of the development process
  text: Design and code go closely together in digital projects. It's great to see the boundaries between designers and developers vanish and Kirby tries to help with that. We want you to feel comfortable with the development process as a designer. Our template engine is so straightforward that many designers without coding knowledge use Kirby to get started.
