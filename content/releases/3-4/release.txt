Breaking:

To ensure proper nesting, Kirby relies on the plugin option default values defined in the plugin using the [`options` extension](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/plugins/extensions/options). If your plugin uses a nested structure in the option defaults, the defaults need to be [changed to use the dot notation](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/plugins/extensions/options#registering-options).

Only options registered in that way can be set in all supported ways (dot notation, fully or partially nested) in the site config. You can read more about this in the [reference](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/plugins/extensions/options#registering-options).
