Breaking:

<info>
We try to avoid breaking changes as much as we can. But we also put a lot of effort in keeping our technical debt in Kirby as low as possible. Sometimes such breaking changes are necessary to move forward with a clean code base.

You might wonder why there are breaking changes in a minor release according to semver.

We stick to the following versioning pattern:

```
{generation}.{major}.{minor}.{patch}
```

**This release is Kirby 3.5.0.0**

Traditionally, we combine patch and minor releases though and never really need the fourth versioning level.
</info>

#### Required PHP Version

With this release **we drop support for PHP&nbsp;7.2**, which has reached end of life. But we also introduce support for the brand new stable version of **PHP&nbsp;8.0**, which has been released on December 1st.

#### Date field `format` option
3.5.0 is dropping the `format` option of the date field. This is a breaking change which we will (link: https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/3026 text: reverse in 3.5.1).

#### `accept` option for file blueprints

If no custom `accept` restrictions are defined in the file blueprint, Kirby will now limit the accepted uploads to the types `image`, `document`, `archive`, `audio` and `video` by default. This protects your sites against unexpected uploads like code files that could be used to attack the server or the visitor's browsers.

You can customize the accepted file types in the (link: docs/reference/panel/blueprints/file#accept text: file blueprint).

Thanks:

A huge thank-you to Tim Ã–tting for creating and maintaining the fabulous Builder plugin. Tim agreed that we could use his plugin as inspiration for our new Blocks field as a replacement for his great plugin. Your work really means a lot to us, Tim!

Thank you to all the contributors who helped with pull requests, translations and tests for this release. Without you, it wouldn't be possible.

Thank you to our amazing community for your ongoing support. Without all your feedback, patience and passion, Kirby wouldn't be where it is today! ðŸ’›
