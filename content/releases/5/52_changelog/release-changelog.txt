Title: Changelog

----

Text:

In addition to all the features listed separately on the (link: /releases/5 text: Kirby 5 release page), there are a lot more enhancements, deprecations and breaking changes in the fineprint:

----

Enhancements:

## Core
- Thumbnails will not any longer be regenerated when page sorting changes [#6432](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6432)
- New `files.sort` permission [#1969](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/1969)
- New `$app->role()` method that works like `$app->user()` to return a specific role or the role of the current user. [#6874](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6874)
- Support for content representation specific site controllers, e.g. `site.rss.php` [#6950](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6950)
- New `Kirby\Cms\Pages::delete(array $ids)` and `Kirby\Cms\Files::delete(array $ids)` methods to handle batch delete for multiple files in a collection.

### Versions
- New `storage` core component which returns the default storage handler for a model [#6867](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6867)
- New (class: Kirby\Cms\ModelWithContent method: version) method to directly access different content versions [#6455](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6455)

  ```php
  // Accessing different versions
  $page->version('latest');
  $page->version('changes');

  // Version method examples
  $page->version('changes')->content();
  $page->version('changes')->save([...]);
  $page->version('changes')->publish();
  $page->version('changes')->delete();
  ```

- New (class: Kirby\Cms\ModelWithContent method: versions) method to get a collection of all versions (currently `changes` and `latest`) [#7059](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/7059)

- (class: Kirby\Cms\Page method: previewUrl) and (class: Kirby\Cms\Site method: previewUrl) now accept a version id to specify which version you want to preview.

  ```php
  $page->previewUrl('latest') // default
  $page->previewUrl('changes')
  ```

- The (class: Kirby\Cms\ModelWithContent method: lock) method returns the new, improved `Kirby\Content\Lock` class, which replaces `Kirby\Cms\ContentLock`

  ```php
  // examples
  $page->lock()->isLocked()
  $page->lock()->modified()
  $page->lock()->modified('d.m.Y')
  $page->lock()->user()?->username()
  ```
- New `Kirby\Content\Changes` class replaces `Kirby\Cms\ContentLocks` to track all unsaved changes across all users and models. This class is mostly internal, but you can use it to get access to changed pages, files and users on the backend.

  ```php
  use Kirby\Content\Changes;

  $changes = new Changes();

  // collection of changed pages
  $changes->pages();
  // collection of changed files
  $changes->files();
  // collection of changed users
  $changes->users();
  ```

- New default `changes` cache, which is active by default. This cache is internally used to keep track of all models with changes that have not been published yet. You can change the cache settings in your config:

  ```php
  // /site/config/config.php
  return [
      'cache' => [
          'changes' => [
              'type' => 'redis'
          ]
      ]
  ];
  ```

- New `Kirby\Content\MemoryStorage` [#6457](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6457) as well as `Kirby\Content\ImmutableMemoryStorage` to keep outdated model information in memory but avoid any mutations. [#6570](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6570)
- The (class: Kirby\Cms\ModelWithContent method: changeStorage) method to move (or copy) the model's storage to a different storage type
- New `Kirby\Content\Translation` class (replacing `Kirby\Content\ContentTranslation`)
- New `Kirby\Content\Translations` class to provide a more type-safe collection for all translations (returned by `Kirby\Cms\ModelWithContent::translations()`).
- New `Kirby\Content\VersionId` class to represent versions [#6436](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6436)

### View buttons
- New (class: Kirby\Panel\Panel method: buttons) method that returns all defined buttons from all Panel areas [#6541](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6541)
- New `Kirby\Panel\Ui` namespace with basic `Kirby\Panel\Ui\Component` and `Kirby\Panel\Ui\Button` classes [#6539](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6539). Each component renders as an array with a `component`, unique `key` and `props` entries
- New `Kirby\Panel\Ui\Buttons\ViewButtons` and `Kirby\Panel\Ui\Buttons\ViewButton` classes [#6542](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6542), responsible for gathering and transforming view buttons configured in blueprints, config files and/or Panel areas
- New classes for core view buttons [#6545](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6545): `Kirby\Panel\Ui\LanguagesDropdown` and `Kirby\Panel\Ui\PreviewDropdownButton`.

### Data
- New third `$fail` argument for `Data::read()` and `Data::decode()`. By default, `Data::read()` and `Data::decode()` will throw an exception if the file does not exist or the data cannot be decoded. By setting `$fail` to false, you can block the exception and return an empty array instead. We’ve refactored our parts of the code where we used a try/catch block to achieve the same.

  ```php
  use Kirby\Data\Data;

  $data = Data::read(__DIR__ . '/missing-file.yml', fail: false);
  $data = Data::decode($brokenData, type: 'json', fail: false);
  ```

- New `$pretty` argument for `Json::encode()`:

  ```php
  use Kirby\Data\Json;

  $prettyJson = Json::encode($data, pretty: true);
  ```

- New UUIDs are fully lowercased now to avoid issues between filesystems handling casing differently [#6566](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6566)

### Languages
- New (class: Kirby\Cms\Language method: ensure) and (class: Kirby\Cms\Languages method: ensure)  methods to get language(s) objects even in single-language mode. Note that these methods are marked as internal and may be changed in a future version. [#6483](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6483)

  ```php
  use Kirby\Cms\Language;
  use Kirby\Cms\Languages;

  // for a single language
  echo Language::ensure('default')->code();

  // for all languages
  foreach (Languages::ensure() as $language) {
    echo $language->code();
  }
  ```

- New (class: Kirby\Cms\Language method: is) method to compare language objects
- New i18n strings
	- `copy.success`
	- `copy.url`
	- `lock.unsaved.files`
	- `lock.unsaved.pages`
	- `lock.unsaved.users`
	- `version.changes`
	- `version.compare`
	- `view`

### API
- New API Routes for saving, publishing and discarding of changes:
	- POST: `/api/(:lock)/changes/discard`
	- POST: `/api/(:lock)/changes/publish`
	- POST:  `/api/(:lock)/changes/save`
- The `files` and `pages` sections introduce new `delete` API endpoints. Those endpoints can take a set of page or file ids and will delete each one. Errors will be caught and sent back in the details array of the final thrown exception.

## Panel
- Radio and select fields: `default` option now supports Kirby queries [#6459](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6459)
- Sections: improved title and info wrapping [#6447](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6447)

- The fields section now passes all values on input of any field instead of updating just the one field (similar to on submit) [#6517](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6517)
- Improved contrast for some theme colors (e.g. `aqua-icon` theme)
- Writer: nodes with `inline: true` in their button definition are displayed as inline buttons in toolbar (instead inside the dropdown) [#6902](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6902)
- Page status button uses custom status labels for `title` [#6911](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6911)

- `accessibility`
- `ai`

  this.$panel.events.on("beforeunload", () => {
    // do something before the window/tab closes.
  });
	```

### Helpers
- New `this.$helper.throttle` JS helper [#6708](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6708)
- New `options` argument for `this.$helper.debounce` JS helper to control leading/trailing behavior [#6708](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6708)

	```
- New `uploadAsChunks` JS helper function [#6421](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6421)

----

Breaking:

## Requirements

- Kirby 5 requires at least PHP 8.2
- Kirby 5 raises browser version requirements for the Panel:
  - Safari 16+
  - Mobile Safari 16+
  - Android Browser 126+
  - Chrome for Android 126+
  -	(other browsers remain unchanged)

## Core

### Config options

- Closures defined for the `content.salt` option will no longer receive a model when generating a salt for preview authentication tokens of drafts and versions as those tokens are now only based on the URI. The salt callback instead receives `null`  and is expected to return a fixed model-independent salt in this case. When generating a salt for a file media token, the file object is still passed as model. [#6836](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6836)
- The `api.methodOverwrite` option has been renamed to `api.methodOverride`
- The `content.fileRedirects` option is now set to `false` by default. This protects uploaded file originals from unauthorized downloads. If you rely on the `https://example.com/some/page/file.pdf` or `https://example.com/some-site-file.pdf` routes, you can set the option to `true` or to a closure to control access dynamically per file. [#7216](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/7216)

### Controllers

- Data/variables from your `site` controller will now be passed to all templates [#6412](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6412)

### Hooks

- Model action `before` hooks: rules get applied before and after the hook runs

### Collections

- PHP type hints have been added to many collection methods. If you are extending Core classes, you might need to add the same to your own classes and methods.

### Models

- `Kirby\Cms\HasMethods::hasMethod()` and `Kirby\Cms\HasMethods::callMethod()` are now protected methods
- `Kirby\Cms\ModelWithContent::lock()` will now always return a `Kirby\Content\Lock` object, even if the model is not currently locked. You can check for that case with `ModelWithContent::lock()->isLocked()`
- `Kirby\Cms\ModelWithContent::version()` and `Kirby\Cms\ModelWithContent::versions()` are no longer available as direct field accessor. You need to use `$model->content()->version()`/`$model->content()->versions()` instead if you are using a field with the name `version`/`versions`.
- `Kirby\Cms\Page::modified()`, `Kirby\Cms\File::modifiedContent()` and `Kirby\Cms\User::modified()` now use the current language instead of the default language.
- Working with old model instances (objects thar already were e.g. updated and returned a new working copy), the models can no longer overwrite their content. This will now throw an exception if you try. Use the new model instances instead.
- All methods in `*Rules` classes are now marked to return void instead of a boolean [#6660](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6660)

### Content & Locking

- Removed `Kirby\Cms\ContentLock` and `Kirby\Cms\ContentLocks` as well as `Kirby\Cms\App::locks()`
- `$kirby->contentToken()` only accepts `object|null` for the `$model` parameter instead of `mixed`. [#6822](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6822)
- Renamed `token` query param for preview URLs to `_token` [#6823](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6823)
- `Kirby\Content\Content::update()` is actively deprecated and must no longer be used. It will throw an exception to find usage early on.

### Pages

- `$page::translation()` returns a single translation in single language mode. It now always returns a `Kirby\Content\Translation` object. This is also included in the `$page::toArray()` method.
- Cache IDs in the pages cache now include a part for the version ID. Currently this is always `.latest`, e.g. `home.latest.html`. [#6827](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6827?new_mergebox=true)
- Removed internal `$page->isVerified()` method in favor of internal `$page->renderVersionFromRequest()` [#6829](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6829)

### Users 

- `User::create()` does no longer accept null as argument.
- Users without a role in their credentials file will now receive the `default` role (if exists), not the `visitor` role anymore [#6656](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6656)
- Setting a `name` field in `User::update()` does no longer have any effect. Use `User::changeName()` instead.

### Roles and Permissions

- If file sorting was previously disabled via the `files.update` permission, the new `file.sort` permission has to be configured accordingly. [#6589](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6589)
- `Kirby\Cms\Role::admin()` has been renamed to `Kirby\Cms\Role::defaultAdmin()` [#7187](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/7187)
- `Kirby\Cms\Role::nobody()` has been renamed to `Kirby\Cms\Role::defaultNobody()` [#7187](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/7187)
- Classes extending `Kirby\Cms\ModelPermissions` need to set their category with the `const CATEGORY` or `static function category()` instead of `protected string $category` and use the static `user()` method instead of `$user` and `$permissions` properties [#6880](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6880)

### Media & Thumbnail generation

- `Kirby\Image\Dimensions::forImage()` now receives an `Kirby\Image\Image` object [#6591](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6591)
- `Kirby\Image\Exif::read()` is now a static method that receives an absolute path to a file [#6591](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6591)
- Thumb driver `autoOrient` option has been removed and now is always applied [#6591](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6591)

### Plugins

- `Kirby\Plugin\Plugin::license()` now returns the `License` object instead of a simple string
- `Kirby\Plugin\Plugin::toArray()` includes the full license info as child array instead of a string

### Forms

- `Kirby\Form\Field::$formFields` has been renamed to `Kirby\Form\Field::$siblings`
- The `$formField` argument in `Kirby\Form\Field::factory()` has been renamed to `$siblings`
- You can no longer pass a value to `Kirby\Form\Field::isEmpty()` Use `Kirby\Form\Field::isEmptyValue($value)` instead.
- `Kirby\Form\Form::fields()` does no longer return null but an empty `Kirby\Form\Fields` collection if there are no fields.
- `Kirby\Form\Field::validate()` returns an array of errors instead of void.
- Removed protected `Kirby\Form\Fields::$errors`, `Kirby\Form\Field::$errors` and `Kirby\Form\FieldClass::$errors` properties [#7131](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/7131)
- The language argument in the protected internal `Kirby\Form\Form::prepareForLanguage()` method is no longer optional and must be a Language object. [#7132](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/7132)
- The `Kirby\Form\Form` class does no longer swallow errors in field classes on construction. This could be considered a breaking change or an debugging enhancement. [#7167](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/7167)
- When using the `Kirby\Form\Form` class, the disabled state of fields will no longer be overwritten on construction for secondary languages. Use `Kirby\Form\Form::toProps()` instead, to get the correct disabled state for each field. When using `Kirby\Form\Form::toProps()`, permissions will also be honored when the model cannot be updated by the user role. [#7166](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/7166)
- `Kirby\Form\Form::$values` has been removed [#7166](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/7166)
- `Kirby\Form\Form::prepareFieldsForLanguage()` has been removed [#7166](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/7166)
- The structure field `::form` method does no longer have a `$values` parameter. Use `$field->form()->fill()` or `$field->form()->submit()` instead if you want to add values to the form. [#7170](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/7170)

### Filesystem

- `F::read()` no longer supports requesting URLs with protocols such as `http://` and `https://`. Please use the `Remote` class for this purpose. [#7099](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/7099)
- `F::read()` no longer silently returns `false` when the file exists but is not readable. Instead it triggers a PHP "Permission denied" warning. [#7099](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/7099)

### Toolkit 

- The `Str::ucfirst()` method no longer lowercases all but the first letter of the text, it only capitalizes the first letter. [#6860](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6860)
- `Str::camel()`, `Str::camelToKebab()`, `Str::float()`, `Str::kebab()`, `Str::kebabToCamel()`, `Str::length()`, `Str::lower()`, `Str::safeTemplate()`, `Str::short()`, `Str::slug()`, `Str::snake()`, `Str::studly()`, `Str::substr()`, `Str::template()`, `Str::ucfirst()`, `Str::ucwords()`, `Str::unhtml()`, `Str::upper()` and `Str::widont()` can no longer be called without a value argument (passing a `null` value still works) [#6401](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6401)
- Passing a single space as value to `Xml::attr()` won't render an empty value anymore but a single space. To render an empty value, please pass an empty string. [#6803](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6803)


## Panel

### Uploads

- Panel uploads can exceed PHP’s `upload_max_filesize` limit [#6421](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6421). If you want to restrict the upload size, please use the file blueprint (link: docs/reference/panel/blueprints/file#accept text: `accept` `maxsize` option)

### Fields

- All fields: `signature` is longer available as field property when loading fields from the Panel backend [#6712](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6712)
- Textarea field: File drag texts in the Panel always use the file UUID, if UUIDs are not disabled [#6948](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6948)
- Date field: Calendar dropdown input will show Sunday now as first day of the week (depending on the user's language). If you want to enforce Monday as first day of the week, you can set the `date.weekday` option to `1`. [#6635](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6635)
- Select field: `empty` prop was removed. Use combination of `required`, `placeholder` and `default` to replicate functionality [#6459](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6459)
- Checkbox and Toggle fields: `required: true` now enforces that these fields need to be checked/toggles (active state)

### Custom Panel CSS

- CSS attribute selectors must be written fully qualified (e.g. `[data-hidden="true"]` as only `[data-hidden]` can start matching also elements where that attribute is `false`) [#6109](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6109)

### Vue Components

- `<k-form>` and `<k-fieldset>` as well as many fields and inputs don't emit an `invalid` event anymore. Use native HTML invalid state of elements instead. [#6099](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6099)
- `novalidate` prop has been removed from all elements but `<k-form>` [#6099](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6099)
- Removed `hasErrors` methods of `<k-fieldset>` [#6173](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6173)
- `<k-file-preview>` got fully refactored. If you were replacing or extending it, your code likely will break. Check out the new custom file preview feature if you want to provide previews for specific files. [#6578](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6578)
- `<k-draggable>`: the `move` callback function is receiving an event with an altered data structure
- While `<k-writer>` is still included as alias for <`k-writer-input`>, some use cases where you accessed the `<k-writer>` component via the `$refs` of `<k-writer-input>` have to be adapted [#6172](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6172)
- `<k-item>`: Removed `data-only-option` attributes
- `<k-dialog>`: Removed `data-has-footer` attribute
- `<k-toggles-input>`: Removed `data-disabled` attribute
- `<k-writer-input>`: Removed `data-toolbar-inline` attribute
- `<k-bubble>`: Removed `data-has-text` attribute
- `<k-header>`: Removed `data-has-buttons` attribute
- `<k-tag>`: Removed `data-has-image` and `data-has-toggle` attributes

### Panel JS API

- `panel.view.isLocked` no longer exists. Use `panel.content.isLocked()` instead [#6515](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6515)
- Vuex and the Vuex content module have been removed.
- The following dialogs no longer send dispatch events via the backend. Dispatch events relied on Vuex.
    - `page.changeTitle`
    - `page.delete`
    - `page.move`
    - `user.delete`
- The `panel.api.users.changePassword()` method now receives three arguments for the user ID, the current password of the acting user (new) and the new password to set [#7186](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/7186)


## API

- The `PATCH`: `account/password` and `PATCH`: `users/$user/password` API routes require an additional `currentPassword`parameter with the password of the acting user unless in password reset mode of the current user [#7186](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/7186)
- Removed API routes:
	- `GET`: `/api/(:all)/lock`
	- `PATCH`: `/api/(:all)/lock`
	- `DELETE`: `/api/(:all)/lock`
	- `PATCH`: `/api/(:all)/unlock`
	- `DELETE`: `/api/(:all)/unlock`

## Translations

- `copy.success` has been renamed to `copy.success.multiple`

- New `Page::normalizeProps()`, `File::normalizeProps()` and `User::normalizeProps()`
- Unit tests for Models have been reorganized and cleaned up
- Use `ModelWithContent::version()` in the core where it makes sense [#6455](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6455)
- `Page::__construct` calls `parent::__construct` after setting the props [#6499](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6499)
- `Site::__construct` calls `parent::__construct` after setting the props [#6499](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6499)

- `File::__construct` calls `parent::__construct` after setting the props [#6499](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6499)
- Simplify `ModelWithContent::writeContent` by using the new `Version::save()` method. [#6505](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6505)
- Simplify `ModelWithContent::content` by using `Language::ensure()` and `Version::content()` [#6505](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6505)

### Roles & Permissions

- `Kirby\Cms\ModelPermissions` now also supports `Kirby\Cms\Language` objects as quasi models [#6876](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6876)
- New `Kirby\Cms\LanguagePermissions` class that inherits the existing logic from `Kirby\Cms\LanguageRules` for consistency with other models [#6876](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6876)
- Globally cache `access` and `list` permissions per permission category, model type and user role to reduce code duplication [#6881](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6881)
- Remove dead code from role shortcut methods for the default `admin` and `nobody` roles [#7187](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/7187)

### Forms

#### `Kirby\Form\Form` class improvements

- New `Kirby\Form\Form::toFormValues()` to return all values for all fields in the collection that can be passed to a frontend form.
- New `Kirby\Form\Form::toStoredValues()` to return all values for all fields in a format that can be stored in our text files.
- The Form class now always passes the injected model to the Fields collection
- The Form class now uses `Kirby\Form\Field::isSaveable` instead of `Kirby\Form\Field::save` consistently.
- `Kirby\Form\Form::errors()` is now an alias for `$form->fields()->errors()` 
- `Kirby\Form\Form::field($name)` is now an alias for `$form->fields()->find($name)`
- Removed an unnecessary check for a blueprint method in the `Form::for` method. `Kirby\Cms\ModelWithContent` has a blueprint method by default and we
already check for `Kirby\Cms\ModelWithContent` child classes with the argument type.
- Refactored language handling in the `Kirby\Form\Form` class with the new `Kirby\Cms\Language::ensure()` method. #7132
- Use named parameters for Form construction throughout our entire code base [#7174](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/7174)

#### `Kirby\Form\Field` class improvements
- New `Kirby\Form\Field::fill($value)` method
- New `Kirby\Form\Field::toFormValue()` method
- New `Kirby\Form\Field::toStoredValue()` method

#### `Kirby\Form\FieldClass` class improvements
- New `Kirby\Form\FieldClass::toFormValue()` method
- New `Kirby\Form\FieldClass::toStoredValue()` method

#### `Kirby\Form\Fields` class improvements
- You can now pass the parent model as second argument to the Fields collection to inject it into any of the given fields.
		```php
		use Kirby\Form\Fields;

		$fields = new Fields(
			fields: [
				'text' => [
					'label' => 'Text',
					'type'  => 'text'
				]
			],
			model: page('blog/hello-world')
		);
		```
- New `Kirby\Form\Fields::defaults()` method to return all default values for all fields.
- New `Kirby\Form\Fields::errors()` method to run validation on all fields and return an array with all errors
- New `Kirby\Form\Fields::fill($values)` method to set the value for each field in the array
- New `Kirby\Form\Fields::findByKey()` and `Kirby\Form\Fields::findByKeyRecursive()` to find fields within fields with `Kirby\Form\Fields::find('parent-field+child-field')` (e.g. a field in a structure field) This has been handled by the `Kirby\Form\Form::field()` method before, but it's the wrong place to do that. With the new collection methods, this is handled in a very similar fashion as we do for pages.
- New `Kirby\Form\Fields::toFormValues()` to return all values for all fields in the collection that can be passed to a frontend form.
- New `Kirby\Form\Fields::toStoredValues()` to return all values for all fields in a format that can be stored in our text files.
- Improved `Kirby\Form\Fields::toArray()` method. You can now provide a proper map function to return custom values for each field in the collection.

#### New Form Field Trait classes

The new trait classes help reduce code redundancy between `Kirby\Form\Field` and `Kirby\Form\FieldClass`
- `Kirby\Form\Mixin\Api`
- `Kirby\Form\Mixin\Model`

### Exceptions

- Exception classes support named arguments [#6618](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6618)

### Hooks 

- New `Kirby\Cms\Events` class that handles low-level hook execution

### API

- New `Kirby\Api\Upload` class to handle file uploads via the REST API [#6421](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6421)

### Toolkit

- New `Kirby\Toolkit\Component::applyProp()` method to allow resetting single props and also improves prop unsetting in custom components.

#### Unit tests

- Switched to PHPUnit Attributes in various test classes. This is work in progress and will happen in more test classes in the future.

## Panel

### Panel UI Backend

- Drastically simplified `Kirby\Panel\ChangesDialog` class, which reads changed models directly on the backend with the new `Kirby\Content\Changes` class and sends the required data for each model directly to the frontend. We no longer need an additional async request.
- Simplified the fields section backend code with the refactored `Kirby\Cms\Form` class [#7168](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/7168)
- New `Kirby\Panel\Controller\Search` class [#6710](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6710)
