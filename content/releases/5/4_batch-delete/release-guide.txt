To activate the batch selection mode, you need to add `batch: true` to the (link: docs/reference/panel/sections/pages#batch-delete-pages text: pages section) or (link: docs/reference/panel/sections/files#batch-delete-files text: files section) in your blueprint.

```yml
gallery:
  type: files
  layout: cards
  batch: true
```
