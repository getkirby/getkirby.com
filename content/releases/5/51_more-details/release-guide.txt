## Site controller

The `site` controller data will now always be merged as default data with data from page template specific controllers. https://feedback.getkirby.com/422

```php "site/controller/site.php"
return function () {
	return [
		'brand' => 'Kirby'
	];
};
```

```php "site/controller/campaign.php"
return function () {
	return [
		'testimonial' => 'Max'
	];
};
```

```php "site/template/campaign.php"
Both are available:

<?= $brand ?>: <?= $testimonial ?>
```

You can also set a site controller for all content representations of a certain type:

```php "site/controller/site.rss.php"
return function () {
	return [
		'generator' => 'Kirby RSS Feed Generator'
	];
};
```

## First day of the week

first day of the week is chosen based on user language or `date.weekday` config option (`0` for Sunday … `6` for Saturday):

```php "site/config/config.php"
return [
	'date' => [
		'weekday' => 0
	]
];
```

## Redis Cache Driver

Redis is one of the most used cache types. We’ve added a brand new Redis cache driver to the core. You can now use it out of the box by setting up the Redis server connection in your config. [#6736](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6736)

```php
<?php

return [
    'cache' => [
        'pages' => [
            'active'   => true,
            'type'     => 'redis',
            'host'     => '127.0.0.1', // default host address
            'port'     => 6379, // default port number
            'auth'     => ['user', 'password'], // optional
            'database' => 0 // optional, but recommended for multiple caches
        ]
    ]
];
```

Redis supports multiple logical databases per Redis instance. If you store multiple caches in Redis, it is strongly recommended to choose a unique `database` number for each. This ensures that each cache gets its own independent namespace and can be flushed independently. You can read more about the concept of Redis databases in the [Redis documentation for the `SELECT` command](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/select/).

## Improved UUID handling
When duplicating a page, all UUIDs within the copied page, its files and children that point to an object that got copied as - well will be replaced with the UUID of the copied version.

If not copying files, any UUID pointing to a file within the copied page gets removed. [#6567](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6567)

## Improved IDE support
Improved IDE autocompletion and type hints for collection items (`$pages`, `$files`, `$users`...) [#6391](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6391#pullrequestreview-1999690640):

```php "site/templates/blog.php"
<?php
/**
 * @var Kirby\Cms\App $kirby
 * @var Kirby\Cms\Site $site
 * @var Kirby\Cms\Page $page
 */
?>

<ul>
  <?php foreach ($page->children() as $child): ?>
    <?php
    // your IDE now understands that $child
    // is a `Kirby\Cms\Page` object
    ?>
  <?php endforeach ?>
</ul>
```

## Improved Panel input validation
The Panel now relies on native HTML form invalid states for its input valiation [#6099](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6099) [#6320](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6320)
	- Choice input: unselected choices get disabled when max is reached [#6343](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6343)
	- Added `<k-input-validator>` helper element to provide native form validation for complex/group inputs and fields [#6321](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/6321)
	- Removed Vuelidate third-party library
