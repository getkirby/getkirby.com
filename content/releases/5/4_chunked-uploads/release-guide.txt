Teaser:

Handling large files just got easier in Kirby 5. With chunked uploads, big files are split into smaller pieces and uploaded step by step. Whether it's high-resolution media or other large assets, this feature ensures smoother uploads, even with hefty files.

----

Intro:

Kirby's chunked uploads in the Panel break down big files into smaller parts, uploading them piece by piece, allowing your editors to upload files of any size.

## Restricting file upload size

Uploads are no longer restricted by the server's `upload_max_filesize` limit but instead uploaded in chunks that are pieced back together on the server.

If you want to keep restricting the upload size to some limits, the file blueprint (link: docs/reference/panel/blueprints/file#accept text: `accept` `maxsize` option) is your friend:


```yml "site/blueprints/files/cover.yml"
accept:
  maxsize: 500000
```
