Teaser:

Kirby 5 gives developers more control with custom view buttons in the Panel. Add tailored options alongside defaults like preview and settings, enhancing workflows for pages, files, users, and more.

----

BlueprintConfig:

```yml "site/blueprints/pages/note.yml"
buttons:
  - preview
  - settings
  myBytton:
    text: My Button
    link: https://getkirby.com
    theme: positive
```

----

Config:

```php "site/config/config.php"
'panel' => [
  'viewButtons' => [
    'site' => [
      'preview',
      'a' => [
        'icon'  => 'heart',
        'text'  => 'Kosmos',
        'theme' => 'purple-icon',
        'link'  => 'https://getkirby.com'
      ]
    ]
  ]
]
```

----

Intro:

Kirby 5 adds new extensions that allow plugin developers to add custom view buttons to most views of the Panel (e.g. page, site, file, user, language). These buttons can be added alongside the default buttons, such as the preview button or settings dropdown button.

There are different ways to define a custom button: in a blueprint, in the `config.php`, in a Panel area or as a full custom Vue component.

### In a blueprint

To select which buttons to show on a particular view you can set the `buttons` option in the corresponding blueprint:

```yml "site/blueprints/pages/note.yml"
buttons:
  - preview
  - settings
```

This way, you can reference existing buttons by name and decide which ones to include and in what order.

### A custom Vue component

Some custom buttons might need more options, more interactivity, more glamour than `<k-view-button>` offers. Those can create their own Vue component in your plugin's JavaScript file:

```js "site/plugins/your-plugin/index.js"
panel.plugin("getkirby/custom-view-buttons", {
  viewButtons: {
    applause: {
      template: `<k-button icon="heart" variant="filled" theme="love" size="sm" @click="applause">Applause</k-button>`,
      methods: {
        applause() {
          alert("👏");
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

You can then reference it by name in your blueprints or config file. Or if you want to pass props as well:

```yml
buttons:
  - preview
  - settings
  - applause
```

### Even Better View buttons

Building upon the foundation from Alpha 1, you can now also define new custom buttons directly in your blueprints:

```yml
buttons:
  - preview
  - settings
  myBytton:
    text: My Button
    link: https://getkirby.com
    theme: positive
```

You can also pass custom Vue component and its props.

```yml
buttons:
  - preview
  - settings
  applause:
    component: k-applause-view-button
    props:
      foo: bar
```

The available options are based on the (link: https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/blob/v5/develop/panel/src/components/View/Buttons/Button.vue text: `k-view-button` component) (better docs will follow until the final release).

#### In the `config.php`

Similarly to the blueprints, buttons can now be defined in your config file. In this case, not for a specific template but in general for the different view types (page, file, site, user, system, ...):

```php "site/config/config.php"
'panel' => [
  'viewButtons' => [
    'site' => [
      'preview',
      'a' => [
        'icon'   => 'heart',
        'text'   => 'Kosmos',
        'theme'  => 'purple-icon',
        'target' => '_blank',
        'link'   => 'https://getkirby.com'
      ],
      'b-dropdown' => [
        'props' => [
          'icon'     => 'info',
          'text'     => 'Info',
          'dropdown' => 'my/dropdown/route'
        ]
      ],
      'c-component' => [
        'component' => 'my-custom-component',
        'props' => [
          'foo' => 'bar'
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
]
```

What you can see above are three different ways to define a custom button:
- The first one directly defines the options. It's a shortcut that assumes these are the props for the `k-view-button` component.
- In the second example, they are already wrapped inside the `props` key. But no `component` is defined, so `k-view-button` is used as well.
- In the third example, we actually define a custom Vue component that should be used instead, alongside passing props to this component.

#### In a Panel area

If you do not want to define just one button via the config, but reuse it (or even ship it as part of your plugin), you can add them to the Panel area extension:

```php "site/plugins/your-plugin/index.php"
Kirby::plugin('custom/buttons', [
  'areas' => [
    'todos' => function () {
      return [
        'buttons' => [
          'todos.add' => function () {
            return [
              'props' => [
                'icon'   => 'add',
                'dialog' => 'todos/create'
              ]
            ];
          }
        ]
      ];
    }
  ]
]);
```

You have the same options for your return  value: full `component`-`props` array or just props on top-level. In addition, you can also return directly a `Kirby\Panel\Ui\Button\ViewButton` object.
