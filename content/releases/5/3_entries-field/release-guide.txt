Text:

The entries field allows you to create and manage multiple entries for the same field. It offers editors a flexible alternative to the (link: /docs/reference/panel/fields/structure text: structure field) for when they need to handle a list of content that only consists of one field.

```yaml
entries:
  type: entries
  min: 2
  max: 4
  required: true
  field:
    type: select
    options:
      design: Design
      architecture: Architecture
      photography: Photography
      3d: 3D
      web: Web
```

```php
<ul>
    <?php foreach($page->entries()->yaml() as $entry): ?>
        <li><?= $entry ?></li>
    <?php endforeach ?>
</ul>
```
