Teaser:

Say goodbye to mystery files! With Kirby's new custom Panel file previews, you can set up the Panel to preview your custom file formats. Whether it's a crucial document or 3D animation, your editor will know exactly what they're dealing with.

Kirby 5 also ships with default basic previews for video and audio files.

Class:

```php
class PdfFilePreview extends FilePreview
{
    public function __construct(
        public File $file,
        public string $component = 'k-pdf-file-preview'
    ) {
    }

    public static function accepts(File $file): bool
    {
        return $file->extension() === 'pdf';
    }
}
```

Intro:

With Kirby 5, we're opening up the preview part of the Panel's file view to more rich media previews that aren't just images.

Text:

It starts with basic previews for video and audio files that now ship as part of the core:

But you can also add custom file previews as plugin extensions to customize the preview for these formats or create previews for other file formats.

Custom file previews consist of two parts:
- a PHP class defining what data is passed to the preview and what files this preview is used for
- a Vue component to render the preview

### Custom `FieldPreview` class

For a custom file preview, you need a new class that extends `Kirby\Panel\Ui\FieldPreview`. In this example, we're building a custom preview for `.glb` files that are used to display 3D data:

```php
class GlbFilePreview extends FilePreview
{
  public function __construct(
    public File $file,
    public string $component = 'k-glb-file-preview'
  ) {
  }

  public static function accepts(File $file): bool
  {
    return $file->extension() === 'glb';
  }
}
```

This is the minimal setup for a custom class. What it does:
- It defines which Vue component to use, in this case `k-glb-file-preview` which we will create later. If no component is specified, `k-default-file-preview` will be used.
- Something you must define is the `::accepts($file)` method. It is used to determine which preview class is used for a certain file. Kirby will loop through all available preview classes and use the first one that accepts the file.


### Register your preview class

To use your custom file preview class, you need to register it as a plugin extension:

```php
Kirby::plugin('your/plugin', [
  'filePreviews' => [
    GlbFilePreview::class
  ]
]);
```

### Vue component

Finally, we need to create the Vue component that is used to render the preview. As above listed, we have named it `k-glb-file-preview`.

By default, file preview components will receive three default props:
- `url` to the file
- `details` array with basic file information (ideally used for `<k-file-preview-details>`)
- `image` object with the thumb icon/image also used in sections etc. (we don't use it for this preview)

We also use the `<k-file-preview-frame>` component as wrapper for our actual 3D model, which adds a pattern background.

```js
panel.plugin("getkirby/custom-file-preview", {
  components: {
    "k-glb-file-preview": {
      template: `
        <figure class="k-default-file-preview k-glb-file-preview">
          <k-file-preview-frame>
            <model-viewer :src="url" />
          </k-file-preview-frame>

          <k-file-preview-details :details="details" />
        </figure>
      `,
      props: {
        details: Array,
        url: String,
      },
    },
  }
});
```

The `<model-viewer>` element is [from a library](https://modelviewer.dev) that helps to actually display the GLB file. I won't go into the details how to use it exactly (loading external script etc.). You can try the (link: https://github.com/getkirby/sandbox/pull/7 text: full custom file view).
