Teaser:


No more guessing games—Kirby 5 introduces custom file previews in the Panel. Configure previews for your unique file formats, from key documents to 3D objects, so editors always know what they’re working with.

Plus, built-in previews for video, audio and PDF files come ready to use.

Class:

```php
class CsvFilePreview extends FilePreview

        public File $file,

    ) {
    }

    public static function accepts(File $file): bool
    {
        return $file->extension() === 'csv';
    }
}
