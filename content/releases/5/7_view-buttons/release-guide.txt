Intro:

Kirby 5 adds a new extension that allows plugin developers to add custom view buttons to most views of the Panel (e.g. page, site, file, user, language). These buttons can be added alongside the default buttons, such as the preview button or settings dropdown button.

There are different ways to define a custom button: in a blueprint, in the `config.php`, in a Panel area and/or as a full custom Vue component:

- In a (link: docs/reference/panel/blueprints/page#view-buttons text: blueprint)
- In the (link: docs/reference/system/options/panel/panel-view-buttons text: `config.php` file)
- In a (link: docs/reference/plugins/extensions/panel-view-buttons text: custom Panel area)
