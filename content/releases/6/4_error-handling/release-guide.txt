Teaser:

Kirby 6 improves Panel error handling with new components for trace output and validation issues, making debugging and form feedback easier to read.
----
Intro:

Error dialogs now provide richer details without losing context, and validation issues are shown in a structured list that can also be reused elsewhere in the Panel.
----
Text:

- New `<k-error-trace>` component for PHP stack traces
- New `k-validation-issues` component for post-submit validation lists
- New `k-request-error-dialog` component
- New `<k-validation-error-dialog>` for better readability of field validation problems
