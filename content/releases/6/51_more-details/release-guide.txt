Text:

## Picker customization

The `picker` option for `files`, `pages` and `users` fields lets you tune picker dialogs (e.g. `size`, `layout`). [#7687](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/7687)

## Panel URL access

The Panel URL is now available inside the Panel as `this.$panel.urls.panel`. [#7800](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/7800)

```js
const panelUrl = this.$panel.urls.panel;
```

## Required PHP extensions

On installation, all required PHP extensions are checked and installation is blocked if one is missing. The system view also shows an alert if an extension is missing. [#7812](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/7812)

## Unsaved changes highlight

Field labels get highlighted when a field has unsaved changes, making it easier to spot what still needs saving. [#7794](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/7794)

## Better drag sorting

Drag sorting in list layout has been improved for pages and files sections. [#7349](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/7349)

## Debug editor URL

Error responses from the backend now include the `editor` URL when debug mode is enabled. [#7782](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/7782)
