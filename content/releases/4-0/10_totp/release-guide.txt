Teaser: Kirby now supports time-based one-time codes (TOTP), offering more secure ways to sign into the Panel. When two-factor authentication is activated, one-time codes from your authenticator app will be used instead of codes via email.

Each user can set up TOTP in the account view in the Panel, adding their secret key to their authenticator app.

----

TotpExample:

```php "site/config/config.php"
return [
    'auth' => [
        'methods' => [
            'password' => ['2fa' => true]
        ]
    ]
];
```

Time-based one-time codes (TOTP) are now supported for two-factor authentication and will be used, when activated for the use, instead one-time codes via email. Each user can set up TOTP in the account view in the Panel, adding their secret key to their authenticator app.

## QR codes
As a side benefit to adding TOTP support, QR code generation is now directly built into Kirby:

```php
$qr = new Kirby\Image\QrCode('https://getkirby.com');
$qr->toSvg(color: '#ff00ff');
$qr->toDataUri(color: '#ff00ff');

$page->myLinkField()->toQrCode()->toSvg();
```
