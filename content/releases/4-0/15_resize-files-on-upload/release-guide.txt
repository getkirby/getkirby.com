Text:

File blueprints can now set resize and crop settings, which will be applied directly after the upload. This is great to avoid huge original files in the content folder.

```yaml
title: Image
create:
  width: 500
  height: 500
  crop: true
```

This feature also adds a newÂ `$file->manipulate(array $options)`. It takes the usual resizing and crop options of Kirby's image processing API and replaces the original file with the resized version.
