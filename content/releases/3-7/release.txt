Features:

- Brand new statistics section
- New search option for pages and files sections [https://kirby.nolt.io/14](https://kirby.nolt.io/14)  [#4316](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4316)
- New field previews in tables for the tags, radio, select, multiselect, checkboxes, structure, blocks, layout, files, pages and users fields. [#4294](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4294) [#4195](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4195)
- New system health checks to detect unintentionally exposed parts of your installation (Git repo, content folder, site folder, kirby folder)
- `$request->auth()` now also handles Kirby's `Session` auth type automatically [#4264](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4264)
- The auth types for `$request->auth()` can now be extended by plugins [#4264](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4264)
- New `$kirby->response()->usesAuth()` and `->usesCookie()` method to tell Kirby's automatic caching system about used `Authorization` headers and cookies. These methods are called automatically when the Kirby `Request` and `Cookie` classes are used.
- New `$kirby->request()->hasAuth()` method to check the existence of the `Authorization` header [#4277](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4277)
- New `$kirby->isNativeComponent($component)` method [#4348](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4348)
- New `k-table` component to create consistent tables easily
- Styled preview for tags in tables
- New JS helper `$helpers.object.isEmpty(value)`

### New Str methods

#### `Str::afterStart()` and `Str::beforeEnd()`
… to remove a substring only from the start or end of a string [#4339](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4339)

#### `Str::camel()` and `Str::studly()`
… for case-altering of strings [#4338](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4338)

```php
echo Str::camel('foo_bar'); //=> fooBar
echo Str::studly('foo_bar'); //=> FooBar
```

#### `Str::increment()`
… for appending a number `-1` to a string or incrementing the ending number to allow `-2`, `-3`, etc. [#4340](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4340)

```php
echo Str::increment('Page-1'); //=> Page-2
echo Str::increment('Page', '_'); //=> Page_1
```

#### `Str::wrap()`
… for wrapping the string with the given strings.

```php
echo Str::wrap($string, '# ', ' {.title}'); //=> # Post title {.title}
echo Str::wrap($string, '"'); //=> "Post title"
```

### New validators

#### `V::json()`
… to validate correctly formatted JSON strings.

```php
if (V::json('{"foo": "Foo"}')) {
  // do something...
}
```

#### `V::empty()` and `V::notEmpty()`

To check for empty values in PHP is not as easy as it sounds like. `empty()` is often giving wrong results. Especially if you pass `0` or `'0'`. The new validators help with this task. They also serve as underlying logic for a better `V::required()`validator. It can now be used in two ways:

With a reference array …

```php
V::required('myField', ['myField' => 'Some value']);
```

or just a value …

```php
V::required('My value');
```

This makes the method more versatile and it can be used in `V::value()`:

```php
V::value('My value', [
  'required' => true,
  'minlength' => 5,
]);
```

----

Enhancements:

#### Custom helpers

Helpers can now be deactivated by setting a global constant named `KIRBY_HELPER_*`, e.g. `KIRBY_HELPER_DUMP` to `false` [#4018](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4018) (link: docs/reference/templates/helpers#deactivate-a-helper-globally text: Check out the documents).

In some cases, our global helper functions will collide with other tools' global functions if they use the same name, e.g. `dump()`. If you are affected by this problem, you can now set the matching constant, e.g. `KIRBY_HELPER_DUMP`, to `false` and Kirby will not register its global helper.

To ensure that Kirby still functions properly, we moved all functionality from the helper functions to class methods (and the global helper functions are only aliases now). We recommend that plugin developers also start using these class methods to ensure that your code always uses Kirby's core helpers:

- New `Cms\App::csrf()` method with the functionality of the `csrf()` helper
- New `Cms\App::image()` method with the functionality of the `image()` helper
- New `Cms\Helpers::deprecated()` method with the functionality of the `deprecated()` helper
- New `Cms\Helpers::size()` method with the functionality of the `size()` helper
- New `Cms\Helpers::dump()` method with the functionality of the `dump()` helper
- New `Cms\Html::css()` method with the functionality of the `css()` helper
- New `Cms\Html::js()` method with the functionality of the `js()` helper
- New `Cms\Html::svg()` method with the functionality of the `svg()` helper
- New `Filesystem\F::loadClasses()` method with the functionality of the `load()` helper
- New `Http\Router::execute()` method with the functionality of the `router()` helper
- New `Http\Response::go()` method with the functionality of the `go()` helper [https://kirby.nolt.io/369](https://kirby.nolt.io/369)
- New `Toolkit\Date::roundedTimestamp()` method with the functionality of the `timestamp()` helper
- New `Toolkit\Str::esc()` method with the functionality of the `esc()` helper
- New `Toolkit\Str::uuid()` method with the functionality of the `uuid()` helper
- New `Toolkit\V::invalid()` method with the functionality of the `invalid()` helper
- Extended `Cms\App::kirbytag()` method with the functionality of the `kirbytag()` helper. Allows to pass an array as first parameter.
- Extended `Cms\App::snippet()` method with the functionality of the `snippet()` helper.
- Extended `Toolkit\Html::attr()` method with the functionality of the `attr()` helper. Allows to pass `$before` and `$after` string.

#### Core

- Added Kirby’s PHP and extension dependencies to `composer.json` [#4216](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4216)
- `Toolkit\Xml::value()` now uses better logic to determine whether a `CDATA` block is needed.  [#4335](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4335)
- Methods in Kirby's core now use the global environment object instead of `$_SERVER` wherever possible
- JSON errors in debug mode now contain the file path relative to the document root for consistency with the API that already handles it like this.
- Kirby's response handling now automatically controls page and HTTP caching based on cookies, session and the `Authorization` request header used by the response. If any of these are used and also contained in the request, the response is considered private. If they are used but not contained in the request, the page is only cached for visitors without these cookies/session/auth. Manual sessions are always considered private. [#3976](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/3976)
- `$pages->find()` can now find pages by their translated URI in secondary languages of multi-lang setups, even in collections without a parent (like `$page->grandChildren()`)

#### Panel

- We've upgraded to Vite 2.9.8 [#4289](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4289)
- `k-items` now supports table layouts [#4328](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4328)
- `k-collection` supports empty state via `empty` props (passing text and icon keys) [#4247](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4247)
- New `k-image-field-preview` and `k-flag-field-preview` components [#4328](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4328)

----

Fixes:

#### Core

- Fixed return type hints to include `null`  as possible return value for `Cms\Pagination::firstPageUrl()`
 and `Cms\Pagination::lastPageUrl()` [#4314](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4314)
- Fixed a bug where field content was copied to secondary languages even though `translate: false` was set [#2577](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/2577)
- Fixed a bug where fields with uppercase field names in virtual pages could not be searched [#4142](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/4142)
- File permissions of all non-executable files in the Kirby repo have been set to `644`. [#4336](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4336)
- Editing a page title before the translation file had been created caused untranslatable fields to be copied to the translation file [#2789](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/2789)
- `kirby->url()` no longer adds the wrong port or protocol on nginx / reverse proxy [#4311](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/4311)
- Url overwrite config now also overwrites protocol correctly [#4234](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/4234)
- `file::url` component no longer breaks the preview URL in the Panel [#4143](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/4143)
- Fixed a regression that prevented page and HTTP caching when the session was accessed, even when the session was not active [#3976](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/3976)
- The behavior of the `$pages->find()`, `$pages->findById()` and `$pages->findByUri()` methods in non-direct-child collections (e.g. `$page->grandChildren()`) is now consistent between single-lang and multi-lang installations [#4105](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/4105)

#### Panel

- `k-empty` now actually supports its `text` prop
- Improved structure field columns on mobile [#3638](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/3638)
- Structure field sticky header inside drawers [#4242](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/4242)
- Fixed wrong draggable ghost element for structure field rows [#4242](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/4242)
- Preview image from other page was not shown when the page is a child of site and status `published` was queried [#4297](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/4297)
- Uploading multiple files now adds correct sorting numbers [#4317](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4317)
- Better responsiveness for Panel section headers [#4316](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4316)
- Fixed Copy & Paste in list blocks on the first try [#3974](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/3974)
- The Panel and API now send the `Cache-Control: no-store, private` response header instead of just `Cache-Control: no-store` for better compatibility with caches like CloudFlare [#4299](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/4299)

----

Breaking:

(docs: releases/breaking-changes vars: version=7)

#### Composer installation

If you install Kirby using Composer, you may run into errors if your command line installation of PHP doesn’t have the extensions installed that Kirby requires. If you are sure that your web server fulfills the requirements, you can use Composer’s `--ignore-platform-reqs` or `--ignore-platform-req=ext-*` flags. [#4216](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4216)

#### Core

- `Http\Router::$beforeEach` and `Http\Router::$afterEach` aren't static anymore. Pass them in an array as second argument to the constructor instead. [#4260](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4260)
- Custom auth type classes in the `Kirby\Http\Request\Auth\` namespace now need to be registered in the `Kirby\Http\Request::$authTypes` array. We also recommend to move the classes to your own namespace to avoid interference with core classes. [#4264](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4264)
- Field names of virtual pages' content are now converted to lowercase. If your virtual page has two fields that only differ in capitalization, only the last defined one will be available.
- The `Server::hosts()` method was removed. Please set the allowed URLs via the `url` option.
- `page` helper now always only returns a `Kirby\Cms\Page` object or `null`, never a pages collection. Only allows passing a single id as parameter. [#4335](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4335)
- `pages` helper now always only returns a `Kirby\Cms\Pages` collection or `null`, never single page object.  [#4335](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4335)
- Creating a `Kirby\Cms\File` object requires the `parent` property now.  [#4335](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4335)
- `Toolkit\Str::toBytes()` strictly only accepts a string as parameter now.  [#4335](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4335)
- The `$pages->children()`, `$pages->drafts()` and `$pages->index()` methods no longer set the `$pages->parent()` object as the collection items can have multiple different parents. This can change the behaviour when finding collection items in secondary languages and when merging collections. [#4105](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/4105)
- The `dump()` and `e()` helper function checks have been removed. If your plugins or dependencies have functions with these two names, you will get an error. You can override the conflicting functions by defining the `KIRBY_HELPER_*` contants. (link: docs/reference/templates/helpers#deactivate-a-helper-globally text: Check out how to do it).
- The second argument of the `kirbytextinline()` and `kti()` helpers has been renamed from `$data` to `$options`

#### Removed methods

----

Refactoring:

#### New `Http\Environment` class

The new object-oriented `Http\Environment` class replaces the former static `Http\Server` class and takes over all its methods.

It takes care of detecting all necessary parts (host, port, https, etc.) and considers an optional allow list of URLs to validate the current environment:

```php
$env = new Environment([
  'allowed' => [
    'https://dev.getkirby.com',
    'https://test.getkirby.com:9999/subfolder'
 ]
]);
```

I.e. if it finds to be running on the test.getkirby.com host from above, https is on and the port is 9999 and the subfolder also matches, you can get all those parts now correctly via:

```php
$env->https();
$env->host();
$env->subfolder();
$env->port();
```

We use this new class as foundational element in our `$kirby` instance to construct absolute and relative URLs, roots and paths. You can access it and its methods with `$kirby->environment()`. Kirby internally uses the `Environment` class to set the site's base URL based on the `url` option.

#### Core

- Improved internal usage of router callbacks [#4260](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4260)
- The Kirby core no longer uses Kirby's helper functions internally but calls the underlying methods directly. [#4018](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4018)
- Content field names are now always handled case-insensitively.
- Kirby's `composer.json` no longer pins the `psr/log` library to a specific version [#4392](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4392)

#### Panel

- Structure field uses `k-table`
- New internal components `k-structure-form`
- Table block preview uses `k-table`
- New internal `k-models-section` [#4247](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4247)
- Refactored `k-pages-section` and `k-files-section` to use (extend) `k-models-section` [#4247](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4247)
- Upgraded JS dependencies [#4329](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4329)

----

Deprecated:

- The `dump` component was deprecated and superseded by the new feature to replace helpers (`KIRBY_HELPER_DUMP` constant). The component will be removed in Kirby 3.8.0. [#4018](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4018)
- `Http\Server` class will be removed in 3.8.0
- The constants in `Http\Server::` are now deprecated and will be removed in 3.8.0. They are no longer needed.
- The `$pages->findById()` and `$pages->findByUri()` methods have been deprecated and will be removed in 3.8.0. If you want to directly get a page by ID, use `$pages->get()`. If you want the previous fuzzy behaviour that queries both by ID and URI, use `$pages->find()`.
- The `$pages->findByIdRecursive()` method has been deprecated and will be removed in v3.8.0. Please use `$pages->find()` instead.
- The `$files->findById()` method has been deprecated and will be removed in v3.8.0. Please use `$files->find()` instead.
- The `$pages->findByKey()`, `$files->findByKey()` and `$users->findByKey()` methods have been marked as internal. Please use the `find()` methods instead.
- The `$inline` parameter in `$kirby->kirbytext()` is deprecated. Use `$options['markdown']['inline']` instead.
- The `$inline` parameter in `$kirby->markdown()` is deprecated. Use `$options['inline']` instead.
- Blueprint presets `page`, `pages` and `files` are deprecated.

#### Deprecation warnings

The following deprecated methods/parts throw warnings in 3.7.0 and will be removed starting in 3.8.0 [#4335](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/4335)
