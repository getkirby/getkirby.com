Intro: The previous/next item navigation in the Panel is a very effective way for editors to move between content. We've drastically improved the usability of the navigation for your users with additional options to customize the links.

## Navigate between all pages

```yaml "/site/blueprints/pages/default.yml"
title: Simple Page
navigation:
    status: all
    template: all
```

## Limit navigation by template & status type

```yaml "/site/blueprints/pages/default.yml"
title: Simple Page
navigation:
    status:
       - draft
       - unlisted
    template:
       - album
       - default
```

## Adjust the sorting of the previous/next page
```yaml "/site/blueprints/pages/default.yml"

navigation:
    status: listed
    template: default
    sortBy: title asc
```
