## Navigate between all pages

```yaml "/site/blueprints/pages/default.yml"
title: Simple Page
navigation:
  status: all
  template: all
```

## Limit navigation by template & status type

```yaml "/site/blueprints/pages/default.yml"
title: Simple Page
navigation:
  status:
    - draft
    - unlisted
  template:
    - album
    - default
```

## Adjust the sorting of the previous/next page
