Title: WebP & AVIF support
----
Intro: With increasingly better browser support for WebP and AVIF on the horizon, optimizing images becomes a lot easier. Our image processing engine now supports both formats.

## Converting files

To convert an existing JPEG, GIF or PNG into a WebP or AVIF file, you need to use the thumb method.

```php
<?= $image->thumb(['width' => 200, 'format' => 'webp']) ?>
```

## Default format option

You can also set the default format option in your config file and convert all images unless you override the format option in the thumb method.

```php "/site/config/config.php"
<?php

return [
  'thumbs' => [
    'format' => 'webp'
  ]
];
```

This is only recommended if you really find yourself converting 90% of your files to that format anyway. Otherwise you will need to override the default quite a lot.

## srcset

The format option can also be used in srcset definitions.

```php

$image->srcset([
  '400vw'  => ['width' => 400, 'format' => 'webp'],
  '800vw'  => ['width' => 800, 'format' => 'webp']
  '1200vw' => ['width' => 1200, 'format' => 'webp']
])
```

## Support

The GDLib/SimpleImage driver currently only supports `webp`, ImageMagick supports `webp` and `avif`.

Be aware that not all browsers support the new formats yet.
