Title: Cardlets
----
Intro: Extend the possibilities of your sections and fields with the new cardlets layout.

Text:

While lists are great for dense information and cards are fantastic if you want to highlight visual content, there's often a gray zone in between. This is where the new `cardlets` layout option shines. Get nice visual previews of your pages and files, while your text content is still representend decently.
