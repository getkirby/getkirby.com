Title: Fiber Sections

With our sections concept in the Panel, we decided to lazy-load each section individually once the main view has been loaded. This works well, but also leads to layout shifts and flickering and adds to the complexity of our sections.

We don't see as many section plugins as we hoped for and one reason is most likely that they are super hard to get right.

With Fiber, we have a chance to rebuild them in a much simpler way. They will be no longer lazy-loaded and as a result their implementation couldn't be more straightforward. In fact, they work exactly like Field plugins â€¦

```php "Section code in the backend"
Kirby::plugin('my/section', [
    'sections' => [
        'message' => [
            'props' => [
                'message' => function (string $message) {
                    return $message;
                }
            ]
        ]
    ]
]);
```

```yaml "Blueprint setup"
sections:
    myCustomSection:
        message: Hello world
```

```html "Vue code"
<template>
    <p>{{ message }}</p>
</template>

<script>
export default {
    props: {
        message: String
    }
}
</script>
```
