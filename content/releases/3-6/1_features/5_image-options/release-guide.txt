Title: New Panel image options
----
Text:

## Image options on the blueprint level

The image options for pages, files and users can now be defined directly in their own blueprint. This significantly simplifies the setup of sections as they all inherit the image settings. You can still set image settings in sections the good old way if needed.

```yaml "site/blueprints/pages/note.yml"
image:
  back: blue-200
  icon: üìù
```

## Support for queries

Panel preview image options now all support our powerful queries:

```yaml "site/blueprints/pages/note.yml"
image:
  back: "{{ page.myCustomBackColor }}"
```

## Custom colors
`back`¬†and¬†`color`¬†options for Panel preview images now support shorthands for core CSS color variables as well as HEX codes or other native CSS color properties (e.g. even gradients):

### CSS color property shorthands

```yaml
image:
  back: "purple-400"
```
Check out the (link: releases/3.6/features/custom-properties text: list of our color properties) for available options.

### Hex codes

```yaml
image:
  back: "#ff0000"
```

### CSS rules

```yaml
image:
  back: "linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(2,0,36,1) 0%, rgba(9,9,121,1) 35%, rgba(0,212,255,1) 100%);"
```
