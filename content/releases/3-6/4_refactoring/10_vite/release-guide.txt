Title: From Vue CLI to Vite
----
Text:

We've moved our build and development process for the Panel to [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

Vite massively increases the HMR performance during development and also the build times. It's a joy to work with.

Local development can now be done directly on the site domain when using the [Kirby Sandbox](https://github.com/getkirby/sandbox). Run `npm run dev` inside `kirby/panel` and open the Panel as normal.
