Title: Breaking changes
----
Text:

Breaking changes in minor releases? 3.6 is not a minor release. We follow the pattern `{generation.major.minor.patch}`

`3.6.0.0` is the 6th major release for Kirby 3 and it's a really big and important step. We don't take breaking changes lightly but they sometimes have to happen in order to keep moving forward.

## Easing the pain

We know that breaking changes suck, when they break your plugins or other parts of your sites. Here's our plan how to ease your pain:

- We will provide a tool to check for breaking changes in your installation.
- We've created aliases for changed classes that will be removed in later releases to give you a transition time.
- Where possible, we will try to help plugin developers with pull requests to migrate their plugins.

## Core

### Deprecated code that has been removed with 3.6.0

| Removed | Use instead |
|-|-|
| `Kirby\Cms\App::setLocale()` | `Kirby\Toolkit\Locale::set()` |
| `Kirby\Cms\Asset::alt()` | - |
| `Kirby\Cms\Page::sort()` | `Kirby\Cms\Page::changeSort()` |
| `Kirby\Cms\KirbyTags::$tagClass` | You cannot set the class for KirbyTag objects to be created via `KirbyTags::parse()` anymore. |
| `GET pages/(:any)/children/blueprints` | `GET pages/(:any)/blueprints` |
| `GET site/children/blueprints` | `GET site/blueprints` |

### Further breaking changes

- Multi-language setup: slugs in content files of the default language will be ignored. The folder names decide the slugs for the default language.
- `Html::encode()`: Single quotes now are also converted
- `Kirby\Image\Image::__toString()` returns the HTML `<img>` tag instead of the root string
- File hooks: the `$upload` parameter is now a `Kirby\Filesystem\File` object, before `Kirby\Image\Image`
- The video embedding helpers and methods no longer throw exceptions if the provided URL is invalid, instead `null` is returned.
- `Kirby\Toolkit\File::header()` now returns `void` instead of an empty `string` by default
- `$files->add()` and `$users->add()` now throw exceptions when something other than a `File`/`User` object, a `Files`/`Users` object or a file/user ID is passed to them. Empty values (`null`, `false` and `true`) are silently ignored. [#3248](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/3248)
- All API endpoints for content locking/unlocking don't display an exception anymore when content locking isn't supported.
- Some argument and property types are now more specific and therefore stricter [#3282](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/3282), [#3241](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/3241)
- `F::niceSize()` doesn't check anymore whether file exists

## Panel

### For all users

- New minimum browser requirements (browsers with native ESM support):
    - Firefox 60+
    - Chrome 61+,
    - Opera 48+
    - macOS Safari 11+
    - Android Browser 81+
    - Chrome for Android 88+
- Direct URLs for tabs have changed, e.g. now `/panel/site/?tab=yourTabName`
- Direct URLs for the users view have changed, e.g. now `/panel/users/?role=yourRole`

### Custom Panel views
- Using custom Panel views (incl. routing, breadcrumbs...) in plugins has changed fundamentally. You will have to use the [new Panel areas feature](/releases/3.6/fiber/areas#area-definition) now.
- Accordingly, the frontend extension `panel.plugin({ view: [...] })` has been  removed. Use Panel areas instead.

### `Kirby\Panel` namespace related

- If you have modified the `->panel*()` in custom models, you now need to return a custom Panel model (based on `Kirby\Panel\Model`) at `$page->panel()` which then takes care of all Panel-related functions, e.g. if you had customized `$page->panelImage()` you need a custom `Kirby\Panel\Page` to then customize `$page->panel()->image()`.
- Use `$model->panel()->image()` instead of `$model->panel()->icon()`
- `$model->panel()->image()` doesn't return `cards` and `list` keys anymore. Instead, `src` and `srcset` keys at the top level that correspond to the new `$layout` parameter.

### Vue component changes

| Removed | Use instead |
|-|-|
| `k-app` | `k-inside` (authenticated) or `k-outside` (unauthenticated) |
| `k-cards` | `k-items`  with `layout: cards` |
| `k-card` | `k-item` with `layout: cards` |
| `k-list` | `k-items`  with `layout: list` |
| `k-list-item` | `k-item` with `layout: list` |
| `k-browser-view` | - |
| `k-custom-view` | - |

- Removed `icon` prop from `k-card` and `k-list-item`. Pass data as part of the `image` prop instead.
- If the `cover` option is not defined for a section, it is disabled by default [#3226](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/3226)

### Helpers & libraries
- `vue-router` has been completely removed, use Panel areas to define custom Panel routes
- Changes in the Vuex store and store modules
    - `content` module doesn't handle content locking information anymore. This in now provided directly to the model views.
    - `language` module has been removed, use `this.$language` and `this.$languages` instead.
    - `system` module has been removed, use `this.$system` instead.
    - `translation` module has been removed, use `this.$translation` instead.
    - `user` module has been removed, use `this.$user` instead.
    - `$store.dispatch('breadcrumb')` and `$store.dispatch('title')`have been removed. Use Panel areas instead.
- The `previewThumb` helper has been removed. `k-item-image` takes care of processing the image data correctly inside `k-item`.
- The following methods from `vuex-i18n` are no longer available in the new custom implementation: `$tc`,  `$tlang`, `$i18n.localeExists`, `$i18n.keyExists`.     Translation strings cannot be added dynamically anymore, only through our official extension.

### CSS Selectors
- `.k-panel[data-translation]` is now `.k-panel[data-language]`
- `.k-panel[data-default-translation]` is now `.k-panel[data-default-translation]`
- CSS class `.k-block-handle` has been replaced with `.k-sort-handle`
