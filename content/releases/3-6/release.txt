ImageSettingsIntro:

- Support for Kirby's (link: docs/guide/blueprints/query-language text: query language)
- Custom colors: `back` and `color` options now support shorthands for (link: https://lab.getkirby.com/public/lab/basics/design/colors text: core CSS colors) as well as HEX codes or other native CSS color properties (e.g. even gradients)
- Per blueprint: The `image` options for pages, files and users can now be defined directly in their own blueprint. You can still set image settings in sections the good old way if needed.

Breaking:

Breaking changes in minor releases? 3.6 is not a minor release. We follow the pattern `{generation.major.minor.patch}`

`3.6.0.0` is the 6th major release for Kirby 3 and it's a really big and important step. We don't take breaking changes lightly but they sometimes have to happen in order to keep moving forward.

## Panel

### For all users

- New minimum **browser requirements** (browsers with native ESM and dynamic `import()` support):

    - Firefox 67+
    - Chrome 63+
    - Edge 79+
    - Opera 50+
    - macOS Safari 11.1+
    - Safari iOS 11+
    - Android Browser 92+
    - Chrome for Android 92+


- Several blueprint options that use the **(link: docs/guide/blueprints/query-language text: query syntax)** were updated to **escape against raw HTML** output that may lead to XSS attacks. HTML code directly in the blueprint option still works as normal. If queries need to return HTML, you can use the new `{< >}` syntax. In this case you need to ensure manually that the returned HTML code is safe. With the `{{ }}` syntax, Kirby performs the escaping for you.

```yaml
# works as normal
info: "This is <strong>{{ page.important }}</strong>"

# custom site method returns HTML, new `{< >}` syntax needed
info: "via {< site.myMethodWithHtml >}"
```

- Direct URLs for tabs have changed, e.g. now `/panel/site/?tab=yourTabName`
- Direct URLs for the users view have changed, e.g. now `/panel/users/?role=yourRole`


### Custom Panel views
- Using custom Panel views (incl. routing, breadcrumbs...) in plugins has changed fundamentally. You will have to use the (link: docs/reference/plugins/extensions/panel-areas text: new Panel areas extension) now.
- Accordingly, the frontend extension `panel.plugin({ view: [...] })` has been  removed. Use Panel areas instead.

### `Kirby\Panel` namespace related

- If you have modified the `->panel*()` methods in custom models, you now need to return a custom Panel model (based on `Kirby\Panel\Model`) at `$page->panel()` which then takes care of all Panel-related functions, e.g. if you had customized `$page->panelImage()` you need a custom `Kirby\Panel\Page` to then customize `$page->panel()->image()`.
- Use `$model->panel()->image()` instead of `$model->panel()->icon()`
- `$model->panel()->image()` doesn't return `cards` and `list` keys anymore. Instead, `src` and `srcset` keys at the top level that correspond to the new `$layout` parameter.

### Vue component changes

| Removed | Use instead |
|-|-|
| `k-app` | `k-inside` (authenticated) or `k-outside` (unauthenticated) |
| `k-cards` | `k-items`  with `layout: cards` |
| `k-card` | `k-item` with `layout: cards` |
| `k-list` | `k-items`  with `layout: list` |
| `k-list-item` | `k-item` with `layout: list` |
| `k-browser-view` | - |
| `k-custom-view` | - |

- Removed `icon` prop from `k-card` and `k-list-item`. Pass data as part of the `image` prop instead to new (link: https://lab.getkirby.com/public/lab/docs/k-item text: `k-item` component).
- If the `cover` option is not defined for a section, it is disabled by default.
- The `<k-box text="..." />` property is now rendered as plain text by default instead of as HTML code. For the previous behavior use `<k-box text="..." :html="true" />`.

### Helpers & libraries
- `vue-router` has been completely removed, use (link: docs/reference/plugins/extensions/panel-areas text: Panel areas) to define custom Panel routes
- Changes in the Vuex store and store modules
    - `content` module doesn't handle content locking information anymore. This in now provided directly to the model views.
    - `language` module has been removed, use `this.$language` and `this.$languages` instead.
    - `system` module has been removed, use `this.$system` instead.
    - `translation` module has been removed, use `this.$translation` instead.
    - `user` module has been removed, use `this.$user` instead.
    - `$store.dispatch('breadcrumb')` and `$store.dispatch('title')`have been removed. Use Panel areas instead.
- The `previewThumb` helper has been removed. `k-item-image` takes care of processing the image data correctly inside `k-item`.
- The following methods from `vuex-i18n` are no longer available in the new custom implementation: `$tc`,  `$tlang`, `$i18n.localeExists`, `$i18n.keyExists`.     Translation strings cannot be added dynamically anymore, only through our official extension.
- Removed outdated $api methods in Vue:
    - `$api.pages.breadcrumb`
    - `$api.files.breadcrumb`
    - `$api.users.breadcrumb`
    - `$api.site.breadcrumb`
    - `$api.site.options`
    - `$api.roles.options`
    - `$api.translations.options`


### CSS Selectors
- `.k-panel[data-translation]` is now `.k-panel[data-language]`
- `.k-panel[data-translation-default]` is now `.k-panel[data-language-default]`
- CSS class `.k-block-handle` has been replaced with `.k-sort-handle`


## Core

- Kirby no longer supports PHP 7.3, which will reach its [end-of-life date](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) soon. We will add support for PHP 8.1 to Kirby as soon as possible after the official release of PHP 8.1.
- Multi-language setup: slugs in content files of the default language will be ignored. The folder names decide the slugs for the default language.
- Hidden blocks in the layout field will no longer be visible (as expected)
- `$files->add()` and `$users->add()` now throw exceptions when something other than a `File`/`User` object, a `Files`/`Users` object or a file/user ID is passed to them. Empty values (`null`, `false` and `true`) are silently ignored. [#3248](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/3248)
- `F::modified()` does no longer calculate a maximum between mtime and ctime for file changes. This could in theory lead to different timestamps in some scenarios. Very unlikely though.
- `Html::encode()`: Single quotes now are also converted
- `Kirby\Image\Image::__toString()` returns the HTML `<img>` tag instead of the root string
- File hooks: the `$upload` parameter is now a `Kirby\Filesystem\File` object, before `Kirby\Image\Image`
- The video embedding helpers and methods no longer throw exceptions if the provided URL is invalid, instead `null` is returned.
- `Kirby\Toolkit\File::header()` now returns `void` instead of an empty `string` by default
- `F::niceSize()` doesn't check anymore whether file exists
- The public static configuration attributes of the `Sane` classes have been renamed for consistency with the new `Toolkit\Dom` class
- The `Sane\Svg::$allowedNamespaces` attribute now expects namespace reference names as the array keys instead of full attribute names (so `xmlns:xlink` should become just `xlink` and `xmlns` should become an empty string)
- The `Sane\Svg::$allowedTags` attribute (before `$allowedElements`) now is an associative array with the allowed attributes for this tag as the value
- All API endpoints for content locking/unlocking don't display an exception anymore when content locking isn't supported.
- The crop keyword is now always present in filenames for cropped files. All center cropped files need to be regenerated.
- `Cms\Collection::has()`: 1st parameter got renamed to `$key`
- `Cms\Collection::indexOf()`: 1st parameter got renamed to `$needle`
- `Cms\Collection::query()`: 1st parameter got renamed to `$arguments`
- Some argument and property types are now more specific and therefore stricter [#3282](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/3282), [#3241](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/3241)
- In multi-lang setups, calling `$pages->find()`, `$pages->findById()` or `$pages->findByUri()` on a non-children collection (e.g. grandchildren) with just a slug no longer works. This makes the `Pages` class more consistent between single and multi language setups.

### Deprecated code that has been removed with 3.6.0

| Removed | Use instead |
|-|-|
| `Kirby\Cms\Asset::alt()` | - |
| `Kirby\Cms\Page::sort()` | `Kirby\Cms\Page::changeSort()` |

Thanks:

A huge thank-you to Tim Ötting for creating and maintaining the fabulous Builder plugin. Tim agreed that we could use his plugin as inspiration for our new Blocks field as a replacement for his great plugin. Your work really means a lot to us, Tim!

Thank you to all the contributors who helped with pull requests, translations and tests for this release. Without you, it wouldn't be possible.

Thank you to our amazing community for your ongoing support. Without all your feedback, patience and passion, Kirby wouldn't be where it is today! 💛
