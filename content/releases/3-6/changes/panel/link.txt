Title: Panel
----

Features:

#### Interface

- **Cardlets**: While lists are great for dense information and cards are fantastic if you want to highlight visual content, there's often a gray zone in between. The new `cardlets` layout option gives you nice visual previews while your text content is still representend decently. Use them in (link: docs/reference/panel/sections/pages#__cardlets-layout text: pages) or (link: docs/reference/panel/sections/files#__cardlets-layout text: files) sections as well as (link: docs/reference/panel/fields/pages text: pages), (link: docs/reference/panel/fields/files text: files) or (link: docs/reference/panel/fields/users text: users) fields.
- **(link: docs/reference/panel/icons text: New icons)** by popular demand
- Set your **(link: docs/reference/system/options/panel#custom-panel-favicon text: own favicon(s)) for the Panel** – the last step to a full white-label solution

#### Blocks

- **Copy & paste for blocks:** It's finally here! You can now copy and paste blocks between block fields and even create blocks from pasted HTML and text.
- **New (link: docs/reference/panel/blocks/line text: line block)**, which automatically supports and imports `hr` blocks from the old Editor plugin.

#### Fields
- **New slug field:** perfect if you want to create sanitized strings for IDs, URL paths, CSS class names, etc. (link: https://getkirby.test/docs/reference/panel/fields/slug text: Learn more ›)
- **New formats for the writer field:** Our writer field is getting more powerful with headings and lists. (link: docs/reference/panel/fields/writer#format-node-options text: Learn more ›)
- **Email dialog** for the writer field

#### Blueprints
- **Image options on steriods:**
  - Support for Kirby's (link: docs/guide/blueprints/query-language text: query language)
  - Custom colors: `back` and `color` options now support shorthands for (link: docs/reference/plugins/ui#colors text: core CSS colors) as well as HEX codes or other native CSS color properties (e.g. even gradients)
  - Per blueprint: The `image` options for pages, files and users can now be defined directly in their own blueprint. You can still set image settings in sections the good old way if needed.
- **`navigation` option:** The previous/next item navigation in the Panel is a very effective way for editors to move between content. We've drastically improved the usability of the navigation for your users (link: docs/reference/panel/blueprints/page#navigation-option text: with additional options) to customize the links.
- **`home` option for users:** When a user logs in to the Panel, they normally get redirected to the last view they were on before they were logged out, or the Site view. When you work with permissions, you might want to block the Site view or redirect the user to a completely different view instead. This is now possible with the (link: docs/reference/panel/blueprints/user#home-option text: new `home` option for user blueprints).

#### More …
- **Improved duplicate dialog**, which now also accepts a title for the new page.
- The settings view has been replaced by a **new system view** with all kinds of additional information about your Kirby installation and a brand **new languages view**.
- The system view contains the version and license information from the previous settings view. But now it also features additional health information about your setup, which will be extended step by step in later releases. It also contains a list of your installed plugins.
