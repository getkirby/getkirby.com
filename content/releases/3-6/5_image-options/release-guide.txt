Title: New Panel image options
----
Text:

All Panel preview image options (back, color, cover, ratio, icon) now support Query syntax

```yaml
image:
  back: "{{ page.panelBack }}"
  icon: false
```

Panel image `back` and `color` options now support shorthands for core CSS color variables as well as HEX codes and all other native CSS color properties (e.g. even gradients)

```yaml
image:
  back: "linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(2,0,36,1) 0%, rgba(9,9,121,1) 35%, rgba(0,212,255,1) 100%);"
```
