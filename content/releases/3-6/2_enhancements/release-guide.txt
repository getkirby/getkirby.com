Title: Enhancements
----

Text:

## Core

- The video embedding helpers and methods now use a much more robust URL parser with support for local and remote URLs. The same parser is used in the Panel for consistency. [#3074](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/3074)
- The `avif` file extension is now considered viewable [#2877](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/2877)
- Invalid media URLs now render the full error page instead of a simple error to avoid information leaks and to allow overriding the error behavior with custom code on the error page. [#3202](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/3202)
- `F::relativepath()` now supports file paths with an unrelated base by prefixing `../` to build a relative path. [#3267](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/3267)
- Improved API error paths when using a custom directory setup
- `Html::encode()` uses the `ENT_QUOTES` constant now for `htmlentities()`, converting both double and single quotes
- `F::size` and `F::niceSize` accept an array of file paths
- `Dir::size()` has a new `$recursive` parameter to calculate the total size of the directory
- The new `license` root allows to store the license outside of the config dir for easier deployments and multi-site setups.
- The default block snippet for the `image` block now escapes the content output from the source, alt and link fields. This protects against XSS attacks against site visitors.
- `Str::widont` applies to punctuation with gap
- The `Data\Json::decode()` and `Data\Xml::decode()` methods now accept empty strings and treat them as an empty data set (empty array) for consistency with `Data\Txt::decode()` and `Data\Yaml::decode()`. [#3565](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/3565)
- Improved plugin asset resolver [#2422](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/2422)
- The video helper now allows custom `<iframe>` attributes
- Added server-side sanitization in the writer field on field changes for extra security against XSS attacks
- Improved error messages for file validation/sanitization errors (`Sane` classes)
- The `Sane` classes now have proper XML namespace support so that custom namespace prefixes are properly detected.
- Improved docblocks for the `HasChildren` trait [#3791](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/3791)
- The `Remote` class now by default prefers the system certificate authority bundle (CA bundle) for verifying remote TLS connections if a bundle is configured in `php.ini` (`curl.cainfo` option). If no bundle is configured, Kirby will still use its internal CA bundle.
- Additional unit tests for `Filesystem`, `Cms`, `Form`, `Image` and `Panel` classes
- Fixed validation code for the `Kirby\Form\FieldClass` class
- Cleaner solution to ignore entire files from code coverage

## Panel

- Much [smaller Panel files](/releases/3.6#fiber) to load
- The license code is now only displayed to admins.
- The loading indicator of the Panel is now located in the breadcrumb.
- New `theme` property for `k-dropdown-content` to switch between `dark` (default) and `light` dropdowns
- `$model->panel()->image()` now supports a second parameter to specify layout (default is `cards`). [#3425](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/3425)
- New `$store.dispatch("content/clear")` Vuex action that removes all unsaved changes from localStorage
- New JS helper to deep-merge objects (`helpers/object.js`)
- New `$helper.clipboard` helper handling reading from/writing to the clipboard
- New `$helper.color` helper for turning a string into a valid CSS color value
- New `Panel` class alias for `Kirby\Panel\Panel`
- Writer field: marks (floating toolbar buttons) now show tooltips
- Blocks without fields don't open empty drawer anymore (e.g. new line block)
- `$t()` JS helper now supports a fallback value as third parameter
- Enhanced CSS support for RTL Panel interface [#3556](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/3556)
- New `v-direction` directive to set the `dir` attribute based on the current content translation [#3568](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/3568)
- File view uses stable preview link for files (instead of media folder URL) [#3575](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/3575)
- File uploads now check for duplicates via SHA1 hashes. This leads to a better upload experience because when you upload the exact same file twice, the upload is simply ignored.
- The files field can now accept new files via drag & drop.
- New files automatically store the sort attribute on upload if the files section is sortable. [#2886](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/2886)
- Instant field and info section loading
- Better string template parsing in block labels [#3661](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/3661)
- The video block is now more privacy friendly by creating embeds with the "do not track" option
- The page position field is hidden from dialogs when only one option is available (except when in `debug` mode)
- Sorting pages is disabled in the page dropdown when only one option would be available
- The toggle field now supports the query syntax in the `text` property.
- The `RadioInput` component now supports (escaped) HTML in the `info` property for radio options.
- The `k-dropdown-content` component is now compatible with our dynamic Fiber dropdowns. You can pass a string for the `options` prop and the component will automatically load the matching Fiber dropdown defined in PHP.
- Moved offline warning to new `k-offline-warning` component. The offline warning is now translatable with `error.offline` and has a new design.

```html
<k-dropdown-content options="my/custom/dropdown" />
```

will now load the Fiber dropdown defined like this in one of your areas:

```php
'dropdowns' => [
  'my/custom/dropdown' => function () {
    return [ ... ];
  }
];
```

- Improved fiber error handling for dialogs and dropdowns
- Multiselect with Cmd/Ctrl keys for blocks field [#3748](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/3748)

- Blocks are now always selected in the original order, no matter in which order they have been selected in.
- Parsing blocks from Word documents is now a lot more reliable and the results will be better.
- Canonical language URLs in the Panel [#3759](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/3759)
- Now default block previews are overwritable [#3776](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/3776)
- Improved parsing content from Word documents to create blocks [#3770](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/3770)
- Add `data-id` for drawer and blocks
- Changes badge position improved on tabs [#3805](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/3805)
- Updated inline docs for the writer field
- Better error handling for dialogs without proper handlers
