Title: Enhancements
----

Text:

## Core

- The video embedding helpers and methods now use a much more robust URL parser with support for local and remote URLs. The same parser is used in the Panel for consistency. [#3074](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/3074)
- The `avif` file extension is now considered viewable [#2877](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/2877)
- Invalid media URLs now render the full error page instead of a simple error to avoid information leaks and to allow overriding the error behavior with custom code on the error page [#3202](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/3202)
- `F::relativepath()` now supports file paths with an unrelated base by prefixing `../` to build a relative path [#3267](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/3267)
- Improved API error paths when using custom directory setup
- `Html::encode()` uses the `ENT_QUOTES` constant now for `htmlentities()`, converting both double and single quotes

## Panel

- Much [smaller Panel files](/releases/3.6#fiber) to load
- The license code is now only displayed to admins
- The loading indicator of the Panel is now located in the breadcrumb
- New `theme` property for `k-dropdown-content` to switch between `dark` (default) and `light` dropdowns
- `$model->panel()->image()` now supports a second parameter to specify layout (default is `cards`) [https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/3425](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/pull/3425)
- New `$store.dispatch("content/clear")` Vuex action that removes all unsaved changes from localStorage.
- New JS helper to deep-merge objects (`helpers/object.js`)
- New `$helper.color` helper for turninga string into a valid CSS color value
- New `Panel` class alias for `Kirby\Panel\Panel`
