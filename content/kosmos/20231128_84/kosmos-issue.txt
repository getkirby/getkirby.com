After many months of hard work, we proudly present: [**Kirby 4**](https://getkirby.com/releases/4) !
It wouldn't have been possible without you, our loyal community who helped so much with testing and your feedback, and the more adventurous ones of you and your clients, who already battle tested it in production.
Thank you!

Kirby 4 is all about a new editing experience for users. With new field types and views, a way to move pages, customizable page create dialogs, query support for sections, options and enhancements for the textarea, writer, blocks and layout fields, and cool image editing improvements, using the Panel is now more impressive than ever.

## Updating to Kirby 4

We have done our best to keep the migration process from Kirby 3 to Kirby 4 as smooth as possible. However, Kirby 4 comes with some breaking changes that might affect your project, particularly if you are using custom code or third party plugins, that might not be compatible (yet).

For details, see our [upgrade guide](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/updates/update-to-v4) .


## New licensing and pricing model

Starting with Kirby 4, we offer two types of Kirby licenses:

(columns…)
**Basic**

A discounted license for individuals, small teams and side projects. This license comes with a revenue limit of € 1M / year.

++++

**Enterprise**

Suitable for larger companies and organizations. This license does not have a revenue limit.

(…columns)

Each license includes all feature updates released within three years from the date when you first activated your license. We also provide free security updates for older versions that may protect your project beyond those three years.

Remember, Kirby 3 licenses bought or first activated after January 1, 2023 are eligible for a free Kirby 4 upgrade! For everyone else, we offer an attractive upgrade price, no matter if you have a license for Kirby 1, Kirby 2 or Kirby 3.

## Kirby meetups

After people from our community recently met with Basti, Nico and Lukas from the Kirby team at the border:none conference in Nuremberg, the idea of organizing a Kirby conference has gained momentum again. And while there is no date yet, [3st](https://www.3st.de/) have offered to host the Kirby conference in Mainz, Germany again.

Meanwhile, some community members have decided to organize local meetups for everyone interested in Kirby. Here are the dates, the first one in Hamburg already tomorrow!

** New Kirby blueprints plugin**

This [new plugin by Bruno Meilick](https://github.com/bnomei/kirby-blueprints) introduces new ways to define PHP Class based Blueprints for Kirby (Kirby 4 only!).
