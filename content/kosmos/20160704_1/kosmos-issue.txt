This is the first episode of our series called "Kirby Kosmos".

- Flo Kosiol published the (link: https://github.com/flokosiol/kirby-focus text: Focus plugin), which allows Panel users to graphically define the most important point of an image so that you can crop images without deleting anything important. Very simple but powerful!

While Kirby has built-in support for the SmartyPants typographer, the plugin features a lot of advanced options to improve your typography.

## Community

- Many Kirby users publish the source code of their Kirby websites on GitHub, which is fantastic for other people using Kirby. Mathieu Etienne has now created a (link: https://github.com/Thiousi/kirby-repos text: list of Kirby repos). Check them out and add yours. :)

Now Algolia have published a new service called (link: https://community.algolia.com/places/ text: Algolia Places), which is great if you need address autocompletion for your web project.
- If you are looking for a nice and simple HTML5 video player, take a look at (link: https://plyr.io/ text: Plyr). Looks beautiful and is quite lightweight. There's also a (link: https://github.com/dpschen/kirby-plyrtag text: Plyr KirbyTag) by Dominik Pschenitschni to easily include Plyr videos into your text fields.

They also made a great tutorial on (link: https://www.git-tower.com/learn/build-your-own-blog/introduction/introduction text: designing & developing a blog) using Kirby.

## Developer Tools

- (link: https://blisk.io/ text: Blisk Browser) comes with a ton of inbuilt tools that promise to help you speed up develpment for desktop and mobile. Most notably it features a set of mobile devices side by side with a desktop view. Currently only available for the Windows users amongst you, but Mac and Linux supposed to be released soon. Check it out.
