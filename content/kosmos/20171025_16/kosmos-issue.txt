Bastian's Kirby Workshop on November 6, 2017 in Berlin is already sold out. If you missed your chance to get a ticket, you can put yourself on [the waiting list](https://ti.to/beyondtellerrand/berlin-2017/with/uicmkkwners). But I'm pretty sure we will see more Kirby workshops in the future…

The Kirby Team is working hard on Kirby Next and the documentation. [Supporters](https://getkirby.com/next) will soon get a chance to play around with a very, very first Test-Starterkit.

In the meantime, we are continuing to improve Kirby 2 and just published [Kirby 2.5.6 RC-1](https://download.getkirby.com/rc/kirby-2.5.6-RC-1.zip) with [important bug fixes](https://getkirby.com/changelog/kirby-2-5-6) and small enhancements. It would be great if you could help us test it, and report any bugs you may find. The public release is planned for week 41.
