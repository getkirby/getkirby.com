## Fresh Kirby Plugins 
- [JSON Feed](https://jsonfeed.org) is a new format for adding feeds to your site, similar to RSS or Atom, but not based on XML but JSON. And guess what? There is already a [Kirby plugin](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/kirby-json-feed) by Stefan Zweifel that supports this new standard, so you can start adding a JSON feed to your blog (free).

- [The Sharingbuttons plugin](https://github.com/flokosiol/kirby-sharingbuttons) by Flo Kosiol provides a page method to add the no-js-no-tracking sharing buttons by [http://sharingbuttons.io] to your website (free).

- Florian Karsten developed [Kirby Tablex](https://github.com/floriankarsten/kirby-tablex), a new field for Kirby that allows you to integrate tables into your page. You can limit the number of columns and add a header via blueprint settings (free).

- David Somers' [Kirby Cache Widget](https://github.com/omz13/kirby-cache-widgets) plugin includes two Panel widgets that provide information about the PHP opcode cache/PHP object cache. You can also flush the cache via those widgets (free). 

- Check your SEO status with this new [Panel widget](https://github.com/dreadnip/kirby-seo-checklist) by Sander de la Marche (free).

## CSS
- There are a couple of well known relative length units in CSS, like em or rem. But did you know that you can also use [`width: 10ch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#Font-relative_lengths) to make a box exactly 10 characters wide based on the elements' font? Works best with monospace fonts, of course.

- Breaking out of a fixed width layout to fill the full viewport is usually achieved using negative margins. [This article](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/breaking-out-with-css-grid-layout/) shows how to do this in a smarter way with CSS grid layout.

- What methods can we apply to contrast text against backgrounds? As often, the answer depends on the use case and on browser support. Check out [this article on CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/methods-contrasting-text-backgrounds/) for some options.

- Want to integrate tooltips into your site? [Microtip](https://github.com/ghosh/microtip) is a tiny CSS-only tooltip library.

## Tools 
- [Clippy](http://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) is a useful little tool that helps you to create CSS clip-path shapes.

## HTTPS
- Setting up HTTPS locally can be tricky and result in browser privacy errors. [This article](https://deliciousbrains.com/https-locally-without-browser-privacy-errors/) shows you how to set up self-signed certificates and shut up browser complaints.

## Responsive Design
- Designing responsively does not only mean designing for different devices but also for different user groups. With the `prefers-reduced-motion`media query supported by Webkit browsers, we can now [serve alternate animations to users that might suffer from motion sickness](https://webkit.org/blog/7551/responsive-design-for-motion/).

## CORS
- For security reasons, the same origin policy usually prevents that a website can access resources on another website. But there are times when we want to do exactly that. Martin Splitt has a [guided tour on CORS](https://medium.com/statuscode/cors-a-guided-tour-4e72230a8739) for us that explains how to achieve that.

## Email
- As web developers, we often have to get our hands dirty with HTML email. [This article on CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/tools-html-email-workflow/) collects some tools that might be useful if you want to create standalone HTML email or integrate a workflow into your Kirby site.
