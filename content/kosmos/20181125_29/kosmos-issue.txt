The previews for the new Kirby website look really promising and a large part of the documentation is done. One of the highlights is the new contributors section with all the wonderful people who have [supported](https://getkirby.com/next) Kirby 3 during development. If you are a supporter and have missed the call to action, you'll find the link to submit your details in the supporters' Slack channel.

Last call: There are still a few seats left for the next [Kirby 3 Workshop](https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/berlin-2018/workshops/kirby-cms) on Monday, November 5, 2018 in Berlin.

## Kirby Plugins

Our developers have been busy again and created shiny new plugins for the upcoming Kirby 3 version. Here is a selection:

- [Kirby 3 Cloudconvert](https://github.com/bnomei/kirby3-cloudconvert) is a plugin that allows you to convert anything to anything using Cloudconvert(https://cloudconvert.com). Free, donations welcome.

- With the [Color Extractor](https://github.com/sylvainjule/kirby-colorextractor) plugin you can extract the dominant color from an image, for example for use in image placeholders. Free.

- Control the lifecycle of a page from publishment to withdrawal with [Kirby 3 SunCyclePages](https://github.com/omz13/kirby3-suncyclepages). Free, coffee welcome.

Many more are already available. Check them out in the [Kirby plugins repo](https://github.com/texnixe/kirby-plugins/issues) and filter by Kirby 3.

<small>Always test third party plugins thoroughly before using them in production.</small>

## JavaScript
- As its name suggests, [JavaScript Visualizer](https://tylermcginnis.com/javascript-visualizer/) is a tool for visualizing how your JavaScript code is interpreted (Execution Context, Hoisting, Closures, and Scopes).

- The [Project Guidelines](https://github.com/elsewhencode/project-guidelines) repo contains a wealth of useful tips for handling (not only) JavaScript projects and the reasons why these should be applied – from using Git over documentation to licensing.

## CSS/Color

- In [On Switching from HEX & RGB to HSL](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/hex-rgb-to-hsl/), Sara Soueidan explains why she made the switch to the HSL format.

- Stefan Zweifel explains [how to support Mojave Dark Mode](https://stefanzweifel.io/posts/support-mojave-dark-mode-with-tailwind-css) in web apps. 

- [Contraste](https://contrasteapp.com) is a nicely made Mac app that checks the accessibility of text colors according to WCAG guidelines. Free, requires macOS High Sierra or newer.

- While color contrast is an important factor when designing a website, more consideration is required to make a website accessible.[ Richard Stach has tips](https://www.secretstache.com/blog/designing-for-color-blind-users/) for designing with color blind people in mind.

## Content

- Shelby Rogers shares insights on [how to use a 404 page to improve the overall user experience](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/11/the-101-course-on-crafting-404-pages/) and how to track these errors to reduce the number of hits on the error page.

## Tools 

- [CSS Scan](https://getcssscan.com) for Chrome and Firefox lets you instantly inspect elements on a website and copy the computed styles to clipboard. Pricing: Pay what you think fair. 

- [Siteaudit](https://github.com/thecreazy/siteaudit) is a configurable command line tool that analyses your site and generates reports for Pagespeed, Lighthouse and A11y.

## Programming (PHP etc.)

- Looking to improve your programming skills? [Courseroot](https://courseroot.com) has a list of free and paid courses on all sorts of subjects from beginner to expert.

## Security

- Improve your website's security with Mozilla's [Laboratory](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/laboratory-by-mozilla/), an experimental Firefox add-on that helps you to create Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.

## This & That​

- A List Apart has started a four-part series called "From URL to Interactive". The first article covers the [server-to-client](https://alistapart.com/article/server-to-client) side, while the second one explores [how HTML tags are transformed into the DOM](https://alistapart.com/article/tags-to-dom) and what we finally see when visiting a website. The other two are yet to come.
