## Take part in our first ever Kirby survey

We just created our first ever Kirby survey. It will (hopefully) give us some great insights into the areas where we are doing well and particularly where we should improve. It only takes about 5 - 10 minutes and is totally anonymous, but you can leave your name and favorite Kirby project(s) if you are willing to come out of the dark.

## Kirby Konf

<warning>
Kirby Konf was cancelled on March 11 because of the Corona virus pandemic.
</warning>

Only two more weeks until our first Kirby Konf will take place in Mainz. We are so excited! The 50 tickets were gone within less than 2 days after the official "call to tickets" and if you were among the unfortunate who didn't manage to get one: I'm sure this meeting won't be the last one, and we will try to share as much from the event as we can.

Because of the Corona virus, we have been in contact with the ministry of health. At this point, they don't see a reason to cancel the event, but also noted that such official statements can change at any time. We will monitor the situation in the next two weeks and keep you updated. Health always takes priority!

## If you can't make it…

If you got a ticket and find that you won't be able to make it or don't want to attend anymore for whatever reason, please be so kind to let us know as soon as you can. You would most likely make someone on the waiting list very happy. Thank you!

## Our partners

We are incredibly happy to have found two great partners for Kirby Konf who will help us cover the cost for the free vegan/vegetarian lunch on the day of the meeting and drinks at the warm-up on Friday night:

## New Releases: 3.3.4 and 3.3.5-rc1

A bit more than two weeks ago, we released [Kirby 3.3.4](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.3.4) with some smaller new features and enhancements, for example the new sticky option for columns in blueprints. We are now in the middle of getting ready for Kirby 3.4, but as an intermediary step we will pre-release a new minor Kirby 3.3.5-rc1 version on Tuesday which includes a lot of PRs by Ahmet Bora 🎉.

## Kirby tip of the month

You probably know that you can create links to easily access the Panel from the frontend with [`$page->panelUrl()`](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/objects/page/panel-url). This is useful if you want to add edit links for logged-in users next to each page title, for example. If you just want a quick way to access the Panel from the frontend, you can use this route:

```php
'routes' => [
  [
    'pattern' => '(:all).panel',
    'language' => '*',
    'action' => function($language, $id) {
      if (kirby()->user() && $page = page($id)) {
        go($page->panelUrl());
      }
    },
  ]
]
```

Once you have added this to your `config.php` or a plugin, you can add `.panel` to each page URL in the browser bar to go and edit this page in the Panel.

## Kirby plugins

With the [Table field](https://github.com/ragi96/table-field) plugin editors can easily fill in flexible tables in the Panel.

[Kirby Likes](https://github.com/medienbaecker/kirby-likes) adds routes, handy page methods and a Panel field so you can easily add likes/hearts/votes to pages.

The [UnitTestKit](https://github.com/bnomei/kirby3-unittestkit)is a Kirby installation with examples of how to unit-test routes, models and custom classes.

The [Kirby Mailjet plugin](https://github.com/bnomei/kirby3-mailjet) got a huge overhaul and now got support for SMS and newsletter/campaign helpers.

[Kirby Yasumi](https://github.com/HashandSalt/kirby3-yasumi) is wrapper around the [Yasumi](https://azuyalabs.github.io/yasumi/) library that gives you a list of official public holidays and the dates they fall on for any country and year.
