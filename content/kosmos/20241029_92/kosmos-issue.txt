And welcome to our totally unspooky Halloween edition üéÉ. We were joking about filling this issue with the creepiest websites, spookiest articles, most horrible plugins etc., but I think you'll find enough if you surf the web long enough. Feel free to send us your most ugly findings‚Ä¶

## Kirby 4.4.1 Release
