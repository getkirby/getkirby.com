Here’s the content from that newsletter converted to Markdown — footer, legal disclaimers and subscription-details removed, leaving just the main content + links.

Welcome to the second edition of Kosmos in 2025! As spring makes its long-awaited arrival in our corner of the world, we're enjoying the warmth of sunny days. For me, it’s the perfect time to extend my cycling tours without the discomfort of frozen hands and feet — wonderful! And just like the season’s change, our spring sale is here to brighten your day and your wallet.

But as always, there's more to this newsletter than business, so enjoy new plugins, interesting articles and videos, and maybe you even find a meeting near you to network with other Kirby enthusiasts.
