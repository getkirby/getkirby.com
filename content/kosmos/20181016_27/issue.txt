If my link list gets longer and longer and the decisions what to put into a Kosmos episode harder and harder, it's a sure sign that summer is coming to an end. So we are back this month with a rather long list of interesting news, articles, tools and resources – and the first projects based on Kirby 3 beta out in the wild.

Together with Marc Thiele, organizer of the [beyond tellerand conferences](https://beyondtellerrand.com), Bastian will be at [WWRuhr #39 in Essen on September 27, 2018](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/wwruhr/events/253677588/), talking about what it feels like when your digital baby grows up.

Save the date: The next hands-on [Kirby Workshop](https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/berlin-2018/workshops/kirby-cms) is scheduled for November 5, 2018 in Berlin during the beyond tellerand conference. It's your chance to get up to speed with all the cool new features and possibilities that Kirby 3 will bring, meet fellow Kirby devs and have a good time.

## About Kirby

## HTML

Sara Soueidan shares an article that sums up [different ways to mark up accordions](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/accordion-markup/) for typical use cases like a FAQ section.

- Aaron Gustafson explores [how to create conversational semantics](https://alistapart.com/article/conversational-semantics) that are not only useful for screen readers but as a means to make our content understandable and useful in "headless" environments, detached from the screen, be it chat bots, virtual assistants or any other form.

## CSS

- Quickstarting your CSS Grid layouts is easy with CSS styles ready to copy and paste from http://grid.malven.co, a nicely made visual cheat sheet.

## Tools & Resources II

- [Coverr](http://www.coverr.co) is like [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) but for video resources, which you can use on your websites for both private and commercial purposes.

- The [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) offers self-paced free learning resources for people wishing to embark on a journey to learn web design basics from HTML to CSS, JavaScript and beyond.

- [From Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com) is a beautifully made website about data visualization. It provides decision trees to let you choose the right type of visualization for your data.

- [Progressive tooling](https://progressivetooling.com) provides an exhaustive list of tools for improving page performance.

## JavaScript

- [Sara Soueidan](https://www.sarasoueidan.com) recently asked on Twitter if there were any resources to automate transforming legacy jQuery code to vanilla JS. Resources mentioned included [Lebab](http://lebab.io/) for modernising older JS code in general and [Unjqueryfy](https://www.unjquerify.com) for translating jQuery to vanilla. I don't know how useful these tools really are, but they might be worth a try.

- With [Splitting.js](https://splitting.js.org) you split words, images, nodes and other elements and then animate them to create interesting effects.

## Typography

- Getting typography right for a project can be tough. [A guide to combining fonts](https://betterwebtype.com/combining-fonts-guide) is based on the book [Better Web Typography for a Better Web](https://betterwebtype.com/web-typography-book-discounted) by Matej Latin and aims to help you find the right font combinations.

## This & That

- In his controversial article, [Google AMP Can Go To Hell](https://www.polemicdigital.com/google-amp-go-to-hell/), the author explains how Google is trying to induce developers to using AMP and why it would be a good idea to ditch it completely.

- In the same line falls news of [Google wanting to "kill" URLs](https://www.wired.com/story/google-wants-to-kill-the-url/), as Charlie Owen points out(https://sonniesedge.co.uk/posts/amp-urls).
