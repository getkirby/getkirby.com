Almost three years ago, on March 21, 2020, our first ever Kirby Konf would have taken place, when the pandemic hit and not only turned all of our lives upside down, but also burst our long awaited conference. In planning Kirby Konf, we took a survey, the results of which we planned to present at the conference.

While we don't have any immediate plans for a new conference (but maybe we can start planning now that life is almost back to normal, what do you think?), we do at least have a new survey, and it would be great if many of you participated. See link below.


## Kirby survey 2023

Tell us what you think about all aspects of Kirby: Features, release cycle, docs, support and more. The survey is completely anonymous, unless you want to tell us who you are.

The survey <del>is</del> was open until March 31st.


## Kirby 3.9.2

Last week, we released [Kirby 3.9.2](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.9.2), which brings back automatic migration for the old editor and builder fields to the blocks field. This will make it easier to migrate your old Kirby sites to 3.9. There are quite a few other new features, enhancements and fixes worth checking out.
