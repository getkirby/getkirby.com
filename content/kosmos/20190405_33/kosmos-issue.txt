The last few weeks have been filled with updates to Kirby 3: the first feature release, version 3.1 [Chamaeleo](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.1.0), followed by patch releases 3.1.1 & 3.1.2-rc1. Kirby 3.1 comes with [conditional fields](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/blueprints/fields#conditional-fields), a feature many of you have been waiting for. We also added [file uploads and file selection](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/fields/textarea#file-upload-and-select) to the textarea field, and many other enhancements. Check them out in our [changelog](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases).

We also have a few new Cookbook recipes for you:

- A basic [email contact form](https://getkirby.com/docs/cookbook/forms/basic-contact-form)
- [Uploading files from frontend](https://getkirby.com/docs/cookbook/forms/file-uploads)
- Two quick tips on [extending KirbyTags](https://getkirby.com/docs/cookbook/extension/extending-kirbytags) and [pages on their own domain](https://getkirby.com/docs/cookbook/navigation/page-on-own-domain)

With our new [Why Kirby? page](https://getkirby.com/why), we are responding to your frequently expressed wishes of having a catalog of the many strengths of Kirby which aims to help you when presenting Kirby to your clients.

## Kirby Plugins

Kirby 3 plugins have finally found a beautiful new [home on our website](https://getkirby.com/plugins). We separated Kirby 3 plugins from those for Kirby 2, which have also moved and now live in the [getkirby-v2 organization](https://github.com/getkirby-v2). And there are, of course, some new plugins:

- Easily add a Google calendar to your site with the [Google Calendar plugin](https://github.com/benediktengel/google-calendar-plugin).
- The popular [Kirby Meta Tags](https://github.com/pedroborges/kirby-meta-tags) plugin is now also available for Kirby 3.

## Design

The An Event Apart website hosts [loads of interesting videos](https://aneventapart.com/news/videos) from these events. The latest addition is a [talk by Jen Simmons](https://aneventapart.com/news/post/everything-you-know-about-web-design-just-changed-by-jen-simmons3) about "intrinsic" web design and how changes in CSS, in browsers themselves etc. all sum up to enable us to actually design in the browser.

## Privacy

[Librefox](https://github.com/intika/Librefox) is Firefox "on privacy steroids". The project's aim is to enforce privacy and security in Firefox by adding hundreds of security and privacy settings while removing add-ons that do not respect privacy.

## JavaScript

No matter if we are building websites or web apps, the devices and network that deliver the result are always the same. In the first part of his article, Jeremy Wagner therefore argues [why we should use JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks responsibly](https://alistapart.com/article/responsible-javascript-part-1).

In the same line of thought is an article by Bridget Stuart, entitled "[Stuffing the frontend](https://www.bridgestew.com/journal/stuffing-the-front-end/)", in which she appeals we "need to get better at applying critical thinking and thoughtful analysis before we start writing code".

## HTML

Chris Coyier wrote an article about all the things to keep in mind when using [mailto links](https://css-tricks.com/all-about-mailto-links/).

Ken Bellows [pleads to stop using so many divs](https://dev.to/kenbellows/stop-using-so-many-divs-an-intro-to-semantic-html-3i9i) and use semantic HTML instead.

## Usability/A11y

[Adam Silver](https://adamsilver.io/articles/user-interfaces-hiding-stuff-should-be-a-last-resort/) explains why hiding stuff in user interfaces–menus, carousels, tool tips, accordions–is often not a good idea and should only happen when it helps the user, not when it only serves to clean up an otherwise cluttered interface.

Representing [many](https://gomakethings.com/we-are-actively-destroying-the-web/) [other](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/the-web-we-broke/) articles that cover the subject, Eric Bailey sums up the depressive findings of [WebAIM’s accessibility analysis](https://webaim.org/projects/million/) in "[Fighting Uphill](https://ericwbailey.design/writing/2019-03-05-fighting-uphill.html)".

## Git

Using [Git History](https://githistory.xyz) you can quickly browse the history of any file in any git repo.

## This & That

Quickly embed comments into your Kirby website with [Commento](https://commento.io). The tool looks nice and focuses on privacy, so might be worth a try.

[CSSBattle](https://cssbattle.dev) is a CSS battling game challenging you to solve tasks with the smallest possible code. Have fun!
