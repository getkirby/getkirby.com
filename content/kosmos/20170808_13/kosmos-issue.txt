Two weeks ago we finally released Kirby 2.5\. with a lot of bug fixes and some useful new little features. The [changelog](https://getkirby.com/changelog/kirby-2-5-0) has all the details for you. Kirby 2.5.2 was released this Tuesday.

Some of you were getting pretty impatient because it took us so long to come up with that new Kirby version. We are sorry for the delay and we heard you. From now on we will have a more regular release cycle that will hopefully make everybody happy (again).

The main reason why Kirby 2.5 was delayed that much is our next big step. You can now [follow us on our journey to Kirby 3](https://getkirby.com/next)!

## Kirby Plugins

- Kirby took over the domain (http://getkirby-plugins.com) from Jonas Döbertin, who did a fantastic job in maintaining that site for years (thanks Jonas!). The domain now redirects to the comprehensive plugin repository created and constantly updated by Jens Tornell and John Coyne (thanks guys).

- In our new "[deprecated plugins repo](https://github.com/kirby-deprecated-plugins)" we collect plugins that have been abandoned by their original developers. While there is no guarantee at all that these plugins are still working or will in the future, the repo may be useful to get inspired. Also, feel free to take over any of these plugins and continue their development.

- Easily define a fallback image with the function provided by the [Image with Default](https://github.com/mec/imageWithDefault) plugin created by Meyric Rawlings (free).

- The [CSV to HTML plugin](https://github.com/lauriiii) by Lauri Liimatta provides a table Kirbytag that takes a CSV file and converts into into an HTML table. If you need support for Excel files, check out the [Kirby Spreadsheet plugin](https://github.com/texnixe/kirby-spreadsheet) (both free).

## New Kirby Themes

### Ma Petite Entreprise
As the French name of [this theme created by Constantin Joly](https://cj-lab.fr/themes/mpe/) suggests, it targets small businesses like a Restaurant, Tattoo Studio or Architect. Features filters, categories, galleries and some customizations.

++++
### Velox
[Velox ](http://themes.vlady.cc/velox/)is a universal, multi-purpose theme by Vladimir Yordanov. Like the [Kirby Starterkit](https://getkirby.com/try), it features a blog, project section and some static pages. Built using the [Bulma CSS framework](http://bulma.io).

## JavaScript

- Do you want to get more familiar with the Javascript console and have 8 minutes to spare? Then [this read](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-the-javascript-console-b57ca9db3e6d) might be just right for you.

- [Infinite scroll](https://infinite-scroll.com) is a Javascript plugin that automatically loads the content of the next page on scroll without a complete page load. Other features include URL updating, support for the history API, loading via button, and a lot of other options.

## Forms

- While Kirby comes with form validation methods for the backend, form validation on the frontend with Javascript can greatly enhance the experience for the user. CSS tricks recently published a four part series about several options you might want to check out: [part 1](https://css-tricks.com/form-validation-part-1-constraint-validation-html/), [part 2](https://css-tricks.com/form-validation-part-2-constraint-validation-api-javascript/), [part 3](https://css-tricks.com/form-validation-part-3-validity-state-api-polyfill/) and [part 4](https://css-tricks.com/form-validation-part-4-validating-mailchimp-subscribe-form/).

- But before you can even start validating your form, you have to get the user to fill it in without much effort. This [article on Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/06/designing-efficient-web-forms/) has some tips.

## Tools

[Mockaroo ](https://www.mockaroo.com) is a data generator tool that lets you generate up to 1000 datasets with different field types in different output formats (JSON, CSV, Excel etc.). The data can then be used to create Kirby structure entries or pages using a script or [plugin](https://github.com/texnixe/kirby-csv-handler).

## CSS

- CSS Grid is hot! Rachel Andrews has recently written two interesting articles about it. The first is about [why you don't need a grid system to use CSS grid layout](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2017/07/01/you-do-not-need-a-css-grid-based-grid-system/) and the second asks [if we can start using CSS grid in production](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2017/07/04/is-it-really-safe-to-start-using-css-grid-layout/).

- The [text-decoration-skip](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration-skip) CSS property specifies what parts of an element’s content any text decoration affecting the element must skip over. This useful property is unfortunately still experimental and browser support limited, but hey!

- Sticky headers can be painful if implemented wrong. Remy Sharp has a [three](https://remysharp.com/2017/06/28/sticky-headers) [part](https://remysharp.com/2017/06/29/smooth-scroll-with-sticky-nav) [series](https://remysharp.com/2017/06/29/css-sticky-nav-and-smooth-scroll) for us about sticky header coding patterns.
