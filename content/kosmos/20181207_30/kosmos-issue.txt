## Kirby Plugins

Our developers have been busy and created shiny new plugins for the upcoming Kirby 3 version. Those of you using Sylvain JulÃ©'s plugins in their Kirby 2 projects, will probably be happy to hear that the following plugins have been ported to Kirby 3:

- [Kirby Imageradio](https://github.com/sylvainjule/kirby-imageradio)
- [Kirby Imageboxes](https://github.com/sylvainjule/kirby-imageboxes)
- [Kirby Annotator](https://github.com/sylvainjule/kirby-annotator)
- And there's also a new one by the same developer: [Kirby Locator](https://github.com/sylvainjule/kirby-locator)

Many more are already available. Check them out in the [Kirby plugins repo](https://github.com/texnixe/kirby-plugins/issues) and filter by Kirby 3.

<small>Always test third party plugins thoroughly before using them in production.</small>

## Kirby Themes

- If you are not so much into developing and still want a Kirby based website, you can always use a third party theme to get you started. The latest kid on the block is the [Pedesa theme by Aristotheme](http://aristotheme.com/pedesa/).

## Kirby How-tos

- Brendan Dawes has written about how to create a simple [Email to Blog Gateway for Kirby](http://brendandawes.com/blog/emailtokirby).

## Cryptography

- Svetlin Nakov is writing a book about practical [cryptography for developers](https://cryptobook.nakov.com). Not quite finished yet, but online and free.

## Security
- Uncritically including third party scripts in your projects can be dangerous, as the Event Stream incident recently showed again. [Details about the incident](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/180565383195/details-about-the-event-stream-incident) were posted on the npm blog last week. In his article ["Exploiting Developer Infrastructure Is Ridiculously Easy"](https://medium.com/s/story/exploiting-developer-infrastructure-is-insanely-easy-9849937e81d4), Jarrod Overson sees big problems in an Open Source system where people build software for free and are expected to continue to do so forever.

- While there are strong reasons to make websites secure, this also has its downsides by making them less accessible or even inaccessible in regions with limited internet access, as [Eric A. Meyer explores in this article](https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2018/08/07/securing-sites-made-them-less-accessible/).

- In ["Securing Your Site like Itâ€™s 1999"](https://24ways.org/2018/securing-your-site-like-its-1999/), Katie Fenn forges a bridge from bad input validation in the early days of the web (still valid today!) to the new dangers we are facing today with ubiquitous npm scripts and the Internet of Things in our homes, and what we can do to protect our projects or ourselves.CSS

## CSS

- [Animation 101](https://github.com/cssanimation/css-animation-101) is a (free) book by Donovan Hutchinson, about, well, animating with CSS but also JavaScript, and including accessibility considerations.

- With all the talk about new CSS features like CSS Grid, we sometimes forget that there are things like absolute positioning that might be the ideal solution to a specific problem, provided we understand how to use them. [This article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-understand-css-position-absolute-once-and-for-all-b71ca10cd3fd) has you covered.

- Heydon Pickering's latest video (definitely worth watching!), is [a guide to making and wrapping shapes in CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCHt8zsbCT4) using things like border-radius, clip-path, the CSS Shapes spec, and paint worklets.

## Images

- Ire Aderinokun explains [why and how to use WebP images today](https://bitsofco.de/why-and-how-to-use-webp-images-today/).

## Typography

- What is font kerning and how to do it with CSS, illustrated in this [guide to kerning](https://icons8.com/articles/ultimate-guide-to-kerning-how-to-kern-font/).

- Zach Leatherman discusses why a [JavaScript approach to font loading](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/js-web-fonts.html) is still worthwhile even though browser support for new and safer CSS-only strategies has improved considerably.

## This & Thatâ€‹

- The Christmas season is the time of [Advent Calendar sites](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/12/web-design-development-advent-roundup-2018/). Rachel Andrew has put together a collection of calendars for web designers and developers.

- GitHub Actions allow you to create tasks to share with others, for example to automate your workflow or connect your project's services. Check out Sarah Drasner's [collection of GitHub Actions](https://github.com/sdras/awesome-actions).

- [humaaans](https://www.humaaans.com) is a library of people illustrations you can download for free and mix and match as you want.
