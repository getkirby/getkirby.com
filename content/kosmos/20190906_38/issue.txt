On Tuesday we released [Kirby 3.2.4](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.2.4) with a pretty impressive list of fixes and improvements. We will have another minor release before the next feature release 3.3.

## New Kirby Workshops

Bastian will run a full-day [Kirby workshop](https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/berlin-2019/workshops/kirby-cms) in Berlin on November 13, 2019 during the beyond tellerrand conference. It will cover everything from starting your project structure to building your own plugins. A Kirby 3 license is included in the workshop price.

A [Kirby Beginner Workshop](https://newadventuresconf.com) will take place on January 22, 2020 in Nottingham, UK during the New Adventures Conference. More infos will be available starting today at 14:00 CEST on their website(https://newadventuresconf.com).

Would be great to meet you on one of these occasions.

## Kirby Plugins

[Kirby Terminal](https://github.com/lukaskleinschmidt/kirby-terminal) is a plugin that allows you to run scripts right from the Panel and monitor their output. Check out the documentation and example scripts to get a better understanding of what the plugin can do for you.

With the [Kirby Plurals plugin](https://github.com/OblikStudio/kirby-plurals) you can use language variables to translate a string according to the language's plural forms defined in the [Unicode CLDR](http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/27/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html).

The [Retrotree plugin](https://bitbucket.org/vitamin2/retrotree/src/master/) provides a custom pages section that displays pages in retro tree fashion.

If you need a JSON editor to use in your panel view plugin, you can use the [Kirby JSON plugin](https://github.com/OblikStudio/kirby-json). It also provides a JSON field for use in your blueprints.

Serve your images via [Imgix](https://www.imgix.com) (paid service) with the [Kirby Imgix](https://github.com/diesdasdigital/kirby-3-imgix) plugin.

The [Timeline editor block](https://github.com/DanielRivers/Kirby-CMS-Timeline-Editor-Block) is a plugin for Kirby's new "WYSIWYG" [Editor plugin](https://github.com/getkirby/editor) and allows creating timelines right in the Editor.

And just in time for this Kosmos issue and probably long-awaited: [Kirby Embed](https://github.com/sylvainjule/kirby-embed), an embed field that displays embeds from various media sites.

And another one: The [Kirby Entity field](https://github.com/OblikStudio/kirby-entity-field) allows you to create groups of fields, like a Structure field with a single entry. It comes with its own field method for rendering the field's content in your templates.

Wow, that's a long list! Thanks to each and every one of you for creating these great plugins.

<small>Always test third-party plugins thoroughly before using them in production.</small>

## Vue Starterkit

The [Kirby Vue Starterkit](https://github.com/jmedveckyh/kirby-vue-starterkit) is a proof-of-concept of using Kirby as a headless CMS in the backend and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) as a UI library on the frontend.

## Kirby Tips & Tricks

If you `dump()` a collection of pages, files, structure objects etc., you only get an array of keys which is often not very useful for inspecting your results. The `toArray()` method converts your collection to an array and thus provides much more useful information.

```php
<?php

$collection = $page->children()->template('article');

dump($collection->toArray());
```
