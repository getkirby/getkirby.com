I hope you had a good start into the new year! For the podcast lovers among you, we have a treat right at the beginning: [Basti chats with Marc Thiele](https://neu-gierig.fm/podcast/2023-bastian-allgeier#content-start) about Kirby (of course!), but also about the state of social media and Twitter, corporate structures and more (in German).

## Meet Kirby 3.9.0 Brookesia

### Snippets with slots
<p class="color-gray-600">Templating on another level</p>


[Snippets with slots](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/templates/snippets#passing-slots-to-snippets) turn your PHP snippets into rich components. Pass full code blocks into a snippet and output them right in the middle of the snippet where you need them.

### Kirby KQL 2.0.0
<p class="color-gray-600">Fully refactored, more features</p>

(image: kql.png)

Kirby's Query Language API combines the flexibility of Kirby's data structures, the power of GraphQL and the simplicity of REST. [KQL 2.0.0](https://github.com/getkirby/kql/releases/tag/2.0.0) comes with all the new query syntax improvements from Kirby 3.8.3 and a fully refactored code base. Get started with the new KQL Playground which provides a set of example queries. Connected to our Starterkit, you can play around with your own queries.

### Staticache 1.0.0
<p class="color-gray-600">Ready for prime time</p>

[Staticache](https://github.com/getkirby/staticache/releases/tag/1.0.0) is our alternative page cache plugin for Kirby that stores responses as fully static files, thus increasing site performance even more.

It now comes with support for multi-language sites and content representations and a new mode that caches custom HTTP response headers.

### Eleventykit
<p class="color-gray-600">Built with Kirby and 11ty</p>

The [Eleventykit](https://github.com/getkirby/eleventykit) is a simple, unstyled example site, built with Kirby and [11ty](https://11ty.dev).

It uses Kirby's [query language (KQL)](https://github.com/getkirby/kql) to fetch articles from our KQL playground.

## Kirby plugins & tools

[Kirby Chunky](https://github.com/dgtl-one/kirby-chunky): Don't worry about file upload limitations anymore and get fast, secure, and resumable uploads using the tus protocol.

Separate your snippet logic from the presentation part with the [Kirby Snippet Controller plugin](https://github.com/lukaskleinschmidt/kirby-snippet-controller).

[Kirby Webfinger](https://github.com/andreasnymark/kirby-webfinger) adds [Webfinger](https://webfinger.net) support to your website. The basic setup enables a Mastodon endpoint, but other endpoints can be configured.

[Template stacks](https://owebstudio.com/kirby/plugins/template-stacks) allows you to repeatedly send data to named stacks from other places in your code. Great in conjunction with the new snippets with slots (see above).
