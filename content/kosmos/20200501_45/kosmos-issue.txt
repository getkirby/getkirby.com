Some of you probably missed our April issue, which I unfortunately had to skip for several reasons. But here we finally are with issue 45 and lots of new stuff 🎉. Hope you are all fine and keeping up the spirit despite the coronavirus' grip.

## Security release

While we are busy working on 3.4 we had to to release a security release this week. 3.3.6 fixes a minor security issue, which affects installations on .dev domains or behind reverse proxies that have no registered Panel users yet. Read more about it here: [https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.3.6.](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.3.6)

## Kirby in the wild 1

While flat-file by nature, Kirby also supports virtual pages from all sorts of sources (database, APIs etc.). Or use Kirby as your backend and go headless on the frontend. The possible solutions are as flexible as your ideas are infinite.

## Kirby tip of the month

[Page models](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/templates/page-models) allow you to add new methods to custom page types or to override Kirby's native page methods. You can, for example, leverage models to modify user input at page creation or to add default values you cannot add through blueprints. The possibilities are endless. In this example, we modify the page slug when a new page is created:

```php
class ArticlePage extends Page
{

  public static function create(array $props): Page
  {
    $props['slug') = 'mynewslug';
    return parent::create($props);
  }
}
```

## Kirby plugins

Easily manage `.zip` backups from Kirby's Panel with [Kirby Backup](https://github.com/sylvainjule/kirby-backups). Requires [Kirby Janitor](https://github.com/bnomei/kirby3-janitor).

Add Two-factor authentication to the Kirby Panel with [Kirby 2fa](https://github.com/graphicmarket/kirby-2fa).

Both [Kirby Resolve](https://github.com/lukaskleinschmidt/kirby-resolve) and [Kirby Bolt](https://github.com/bnomei/kirby3-bolt) are plugins aimed at speeding up page look-ups in Kirby.

[Kirby 3 Vips thumbnail](https://github.com/floriankarsten/kirby3-vipsthumbnail) is a thumbs driver for libvips, which is particularly useful if you have to deal with very large images.

[Micropublisher](https://github.com/sebastiangreger/kirby3-micropublisher) provides an adaptable Micropub endpoint for Kirby. The plugin is still in beta, and testers are welcome. You can read more about it in [Sebastian's accompanying article](https://sebastiangreger.net/2020/04/designing-micropub-for-kirby).
