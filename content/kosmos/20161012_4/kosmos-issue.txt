Another month has passed since our last Kosmos episode and we are super excited to share a ton of hot news, interesting resources and useful links with you.

Last week, with the release of (link: https://getkirby.com/changelog/kirby-2-4-0-beta-1 text: Kirby 2.4.0 beta), **Panel permissions** have finally made it into Kirby. And there are tons of other new features, enhancements, and improvements to discover. We are looking forward to your help and feedback to remove any issues before the final release.

We've also written up two new cookbook recipes ([Ajax Form Validation](https://getkirby.com/docs/cookbook/ajax-form-validation) and [Ajax Load More](https://getkirby.com/docs/cookbook/content-representations/ajax-load-more)) that make use of the new "Content Representations" feature. Try them out!

## Vote for Kirby – CMS Critic Awards

- We are nominated for Best Small Business CMS at the (link: https://www.cmscritic.com/awards text: CMS Critic Awards).

## Kirby Plugins

- The (link: https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-headline-jump text: Headline Jump field plugin made by Jens Tornell adds an index of headlines in the sidebar, so that editors can navigate more easily in long forms.

It adds a panel page with datatables for filtering or searching users, and allows separating users from admins in a custom user folder.
