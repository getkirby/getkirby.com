## Cookbook

Kirby's new Panel areas introduced in Kirby 3.6 open up whole new possibilities to create your own apps inside the Panel. To help you develop your own, we have created a new [advanced Panel area recipe](https://getkirby.com/docs/cookbook/panel/advanced-panel-area) complete with dialogs, dropdowns, sub-views, and a sortable table.

## Kirby Plugins

Extend Kirby’s templates with a powerful [layout system](https://github.com/getkirby/layouts), which allows you to define layouts with slots, which will then be filled with content by templates.

[Form Blocks](https://github.com/youngcut/kirby-form-blocks) is a custom form builder for the blocks/layouts field.

The [Translated Layout plugin](https://github.com/Daandelange/kirby3-TranslatedLayout) provides a layout field that forces translations to have the same structure as the original language version.

The [A11yprompter](https://github.com/sebastiangreger/kirby3-a11yprompter) is a tiny wrapper to easily add a user-friendly automatic content accessibility checker to the frontend of your Kirby website.

Quickly copy & paste commonly used characters with the [Kirby punctuation section](https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirby-punctuation-section).

[Localizer for Kirby](https://github.com/gearsdigital/localizer-for-kirby) lets you modify every localized string within the Panel, including strings from other plugins.

With the [Tabs field](https://github.com/Daandelange/kirby3-TabsField) for the Panel, you can move fields into tabs depending on `$field->when()` conditions.

<small>Note that we do not test plugins we list here. Therefore, always test third-party plugins thoroughly before using them in production.</small>
