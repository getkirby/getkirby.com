This episode starts with a big Thank You. Thank you, Jens Törnell, for your work in the past, and thanks to every one of you who contributes to making the Kirby community what is is by writing plugins, helping others on the forum, engaging in discussions in the [Kirby 3](https://getkirby.com/next) Slack, testing Beta versions or creating issues on GitHub. All your efforts are highly appreciated and make working with and for Kirby such fun.

Have you always wanted to learn Kirby 3 right from its creator? There are still some seats left for the [next Kirby Workshop](https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/berlin-2018/workshops/kirby-cms) on November 5, 2018 in Berlin. Come and share your experiences with other Kirby devs and have a fun time learning. All levels welcome.

## Kirby Plugins

Jens Törnell, former developer of many Kirby plugins, has transferred some of his Kirby repos to other developers.

- Flo Kosiol continues [development of the Panel Brands](https://github.com/flokosiol/kirby-panel-brand) plugin.

- Bruno Meilick inherited the [Kirby Robots Writer](https://github.com/bnomei/kirby-robots-writer) plugin and has already created a version for Kirby 3.

- The [collection of Kirby themes](https://github.com/wachilt/kirby-themes) is now in the hands of John Coyne.

- And I have taken over the responsibility for the [Kirby Plugins repo](https://github.com/texnixe/kirby-plugins).

- All other plugins have been moved to our [plugin rescue station](https://github.com/kirby-deprecated-plugins). If you'd like to adopt one of these abandoned digital babies, get in touch with me.

For those of you who have already started developing with Kirby 3, there are also some newly added Kirby 3 plugins:

- [Kirby 3 redirects](https://github.com/bnomei/kirby3-redirects) by Bruno Meilick 

- [Kirby 3 feeds](https://github.com/omz13/kirby3-feeds) by David Somers 

- [Kirby Pagesdisplay](https://github.com/rasteiner/kirby-pagesdisplay) by Roman Steiner

All available plugins are listed in the Kirby plugins repo mentioned above, just filter by Kirby 3.

<small>Always test third party plugins thoroughly before using them in production.</small>

## CSS

- The [MDN CSS Layout Cookbook](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook) collects recipes for common website layout problems. It doesn't just contain reusable code but also gives tips on best practices and when to use what.

- Lara Schenk on [CSS as a programming language](https://notlaura.com/css-is-a-programming-language/).

## Javascript

- Leave `console.log()` behind after reading Parag Zaveri's [introduction to using dev tools to debug your JavaScript](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/stopping-using-console-log-and-start-using-your-browsers-debugger-62bc893d93ff). 

## Tools

- The [Colorbox](https://www.colorbox.io) tool offers a visual approach to building color systems. [This article](https://design.lyft.com/re-approaching-color-9e604ba22c88) provides some background why the tool was developed.

## Forms

- While forms are ubiquitous in digital products, they are a hard nut to crack. Making them work for anyone doesn't make the task any easier. Just in time for Christmas, Smashing Magazine published the brand new book on [Form Design Patterns](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/form-design-patterns/) by Adam Silver ([excerpt](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/10/form-design-patterns-excerpt-a-registration-form/)). Maybe something for your Christmas wish list or a present for a friend. 

## Frontend (for beginners)

- For a small donation of $10 you get live streaming access to all learning materials of [Frontend Masters Bootcamp](https://frontendmasters.com/bootcamp/), a course for beginners of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which takes place from October 29 - November 9, 2018.

## Inclusive Design

Dion Wise on [how to make inclusive web patterns ubiquitous](https://www.lemonade.com.au/blog/a-quest-to-make-inclusive-web-practices-ubiquitous).

## This & That

- The energy use of the Internet is exploding, due to ever larger websites, use of video, time spent online and many other factors. In ["How to Build a Low Tech Website"](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website/), the authors of Low-Tech Magazine explain why this is the case and what they have done to bring down the energy use of their own website.

- In ["One Small Step for the Web"](https://medium.com/@timberners_lee/one-small-step-for-the-web-87f92217d085), Tim Berners-Lee introduces project "Solid", a platform intended to empower people to be in charge of their data and decide who to share it with, building a web people they can trust.

## Last Minute
