The year is slowly coming to an end, less than 6 weeks until Christmas or the winter holidays. I'm really looking forward to this time of the year more than usual. This year has been particularly exhausting with all the negative news and the brutal war against Ukraine, even if at the same time this feeling seems somehow ridiculous for someone who is not directly affected.

But before we get into the holiday spirit too much, there is a lot of new stuff today, and I'm pretty sure there will be another Kosmos edition before the year ends.
