We have exciting news today: Kirby 3.8.0 is here and it comes **with the most voted feature by our community finally implemented: Unique IDs**.

Check out all the updates and donâ€™t miss our release sale â€¦

## Kirby 3.8.0

### New Unique ID system
<p class="color-gray-600">For everlasting relationships</p>


No more lost relationships in picker fields because you changed the slug of a page, or renamed a file or updated a user id.

The new object field allows you to create data objects. This is super handy for more complex settings, isolated entities or nested data.


### Good-bye PHP 7.4, hello PHP 8+
<p class="color-gray-600">Use the potential of a modern PHP environment</p>

(columnsâ€¦)

Â 
With PHP 7.4 reaching end of live, we drop its support in Kirby 3.8.0. PHP 8 not only brings an incredible performance boost but also language features that move Kirby forward.

With new ratio, crop and caption fields, the gallery block is now much more powerful.

Of course, the preview respects those settings.

### New Kirby CLI
