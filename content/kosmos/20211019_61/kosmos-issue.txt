With Kirby 3.6-RC1, which we are releasing today, we are finally approaching the final [release of Kirby 3.6](https://getkirby.com/releases/3.6).

## So what's new in the RC?

In addition to all the great features we already introduced, the RC has some nice surprises. Here is a summary of some highlights, including the changes already added in Beta 3:

- New `k-error-dialog` component for detailed error messages
- Default block previews can be overwritten
- Improved parsing content from Word documents to create blocks
- Option to add custom email providersPossibility to create custom block and layout methods
- Extendable blocks models

## Kirby Plugins

If you plan to use [Fathom analytics](https://usefathom.com/), a privacy-friendly analytics software, on your Kirby website, check out the new [Kirby Fathom Analytics plugin](https://github.com/PaulMorel/kirby3-fathom-analytics).

The [Kirby 3 Gnupg plugin](https://github.com/fundevogel/kirby3-gnupg) adds information about PGP public keys when you upload .asc files. The plugin does this using the gpg binary which is a requirement.

The [Kirby VP Kit](https://github.com/bvdputte/kirby-vpkit/) is a boilerplate that promises to simplify setting up virtual pages in Kirby in multiple languages.

As its name suggests, the [Kirby column settings](https://github.com/Adaphath/kirby-column-settings) plugin provides the option to add column settings to [Kirby's layout field](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/fields/layout) type.

<small>Note that we do not test plugins we list here. Therefore, always test third-party plugins thoroughly before using them in production.</small>
