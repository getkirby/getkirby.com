It is decided! Meet other Kirby users, developers and the team on March 21, 2020, in Mainz, Germany, for our very first [**Kirby Konf**](https://colloq.io/events/kirby-konf/2020/mainz/1) ever.

Last week, Bastian and I met with Flo Kosiol and the people from [3st digital](https://3st-digital.de/), who invited us to host the conference in their offices, a beautiful venue facing the river Rhine. We are very much looking forward to meeting you all there. If you want to attend, click the "Attend" button on the [conference website](https://colloq.io/events/kirby-konf/2020/mainz/1). You can discuss your ideas for the event in our [Kirby Konf repo](https://github.com/getkirby/konf).

## Trioceros is here!

Also known as [Kirby 3.3.0](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases) and probably the Kirby 3 release with the longest changelog so far. Hundreds of GitHub issues were closed during its development. Some highlights: Search and pagination in [users](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/fields/users), [pages](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/fields/pages) and [files](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/fields/files) fields, [language specific SmartyPants](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/system/options/smartypants#language-specific-replacements), [unsaved changes' overview](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/content/publishing-workflow#unsaved-changes) in the Panel, [new icons](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/icons), a [last minute config option](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/system/options/ready), and a lot more.

## Kirby Editor 1.0.0 ðŸš€

[Kirby Editor](https://github.com/getkirby/editor) is a new official visual writing and layout field for Kirby â€“ and a game changer. Compose long-form text with consistent inline styles. Add images, videos, quotes and more. Bring your own block types and always rest assured that the output will be valid, customizable HTML. On top, it delivers structured JSON content you can use for different output channels. And you can even import and export content.

## Kirby plugins

Automatically convert uploaded files to WebP on the server with the [Kirby WebP plugin](https://github.com/HashandSalt/kirby3-webp). It comes with a snippet and a KirbyTag to include WebP images in your website.

The [Kirby 3 Stopwatch plugin](https://github.com/bnomei/kirby3-stopwatch) is wrapper around the Symfony Stopwatch component and provides a way to measure execution time of parts of your code.

The [Color Palette plugin](https://github.com/sylvainjule/kirby-color-palette/tree/custom-classes) now comes with a branch that does not store a color value but you predefine, for example a CSS class, that can then be used in your templates.

The [Murby](https://github.com/FNGR2911/murby) Starterkit comes with Composer workflow, webpack, SASS, Babel, and more.

And there's a new [Sitemap plugin](https://gitlab.com/cre8ivclick/sitemapper) with support for multi-language sites.

<small>Always test third-party plugins thoroughly before using them in production.</small>

## Kirby tip of the month

In a multi-language site, you can use `$page->translation($langCode)->exists()` to check if a translation file in the given language exists. You can also use this to filter pages by existing translation.

```php
$translatedPages = $page->children()->filter(function($child) use($kirby) {
    return $child->translation($kirby->language()->code())->exists();
});
```

If you want, you can wrap this code in a custom method. Keep in mind that this doesn't mean the page was actually translated. If you want to make sure that a page is fully translated, a checkbox or toggle field that marks a translation as ready for publication is the better option.

## Kirby Docs

We enhanced the [Virtual Pages guide](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/virtual-pages) with a more detailed database example, content locking docs and a chapter about merging local data with data from other content sources.

## CSS

Lukas Kleinschmidt created a [utility class generator](https://gist.github.com/lukaskleinschmidt/f4c10d15d013fec8f8b8a341d9ade859) like Tailwind CSS but in pure SCSS.

Styling underlines will finally be a lot more powerful with new CSS options. Check them out in [this video by Jen Simmons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZS-7RX_c7g).
