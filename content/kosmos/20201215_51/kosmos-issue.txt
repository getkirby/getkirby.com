## This & That

A Kosmos issue wouldn't be a true Kosmos issue without a look outside the box:

The [Vivaldi browser now has an integrated email client](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2020/11/vivaldi-browser-integrated-email-client), might be interesting for people like me who are not happy with current email clients on Linux.
