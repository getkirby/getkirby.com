Summer is approaching fast, more and more people are getting their vaccination and the infection rates are finally dropping. If we are lucky and stay cautious, I really hope for all of us that our lives will return to some degree of normality.

Meanwhile, in the Kirbyverse: We are working hard on Kirby 3.6 and new features, and our fantastic community has surpassed itself. So this issue is packed with new plugins, new articles and recipes, a video from the show with Georg Obermayr… But sit back and read for yourself...

## Kirby 3.5.6

On Tuesday we released [Kirby 3.5.6](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.6) with new helper methods, updated translations and fixes for bugs reported by our community. Thanks to everyone who participated with translations, issue reports and pull requests!

## Kirby in the wild 1

Websites created with Kirby out in the wild are always a great source of inspiration and show that with its flexibility and extensibility, there are hardly any limits to what you can create with Kirby.

## Kirby in the wild 2: Content first at LOWA

On June 2nd, Georg Obermayr allowed us a look behind the scenes at a major Kirby project with a fascinating setup. If you missed the show, you can now [(re-)watch the video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zrgqExDS68) or the [Kirby Hub on Vito](https://vi.to/hubs/kirby/pages/videos).

## Plugins & Kits

Keep track of content changes and switch between different versions from the Kirby 3 Panel with [Kirby Versions.](https://github.com/lukasbestle/kirby-versions)

[Load routes from site/routes](https://github.com/presprog/kirby-route-attributes) and annotate metadata with PHP 8 attributes. No more business logic in your config files.

The [Kirby Fields block preview plugin](https://github.com/jongacnik/kirby-fields-block) does not really provide a typical preview but rather renders the individual block fields, allowing for direct inline editing.

Disable Google's FLoC tracking for your website's visitors by adding a 'Permissions-Policy' HTTP header using the [Kirby FloC Off](https://github.com/bvdputte/kirby-floc-off) plugin.

With the [Kirby Upload Extended](https://github.com/werbschaft/kirby-upload-extended) plugin you can resize, compress or rename files on upload.

[Alfred Kirby Search](https://github.com/adamkiss/alfred-kirby-search) provides a fast way of searching Kirby's docs with an Alfred workflow.
