Since "life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans", our announcement regarding RC 2.5.9 was a bit premature. Sorry for the confusion. But the RC is now out since yesterday and we'd be super happy if you could throw it onto your projects, test it and report back to us, so that we can finally release Kirby 2.5.9 next week. Check out the [changelog](https://getkirby.com/changelog/kirby-2-5-9) where you'll also find the download link.

## Kirby Enhanced

- Integrate basic Google Analytics right in your Panel with Steffen Gier's [Analytics Dashboard](https://github.com/gearsdigital/kirby-analytics-dashboard) plugin. Currently, only one widget is available, but more are planned (free).

- Cache busting assets seems to be quite popular among Kirby users, we now have three plugins to choose from: The ["original"](https://github.com/getkirby-plugins/cachebuster-plugin) by Bastian Allgeier, the ["give-me-a-versioned-URL"](https://github.com/pedroborges/kirby-asset-cachebuster) version by Pedro Borges, and the ["bust-it-all"](https://github.com/HashandSalt/autobuster)alternative by James Steel (all free).

- Jens Tornell is back with a new plugin called [Kirby Shortcode](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-shortcode), an alternative to Kirbytags (free).

- I have added a [collection of custom page(s)/file(s)/field methods](https://github.com/texnixe/kirby-custom-methods) on GitHub, intended both as ready-to-use assets and as a source for inspiration. You are invited to create pull requests with your own methods to enhance the collection (free).

<small>Always test third party plugins thoroughly before using them in production!</small>

## JS

- The [Vanilla JS Toolkit](https://vanillajstoolkit.com) is a resource for code snippets, helper functions, polyfills, and more, all in plain JavaScript.

- The draft of the [third edition of Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/3rd_edition/) is available online for free.

## CSS

- Get 25 videos (4 hours) of CSS grid education from the basics to real world examples for free on [CSS Grid](https://cssgrid.io). All you have to do is give away your email address to register.

## HTML

- What is the best way for marking up download links? A button element? An anchor tag? [Eric Bailey has a solid answer](https://css-tricks.com/building-good-download-button/).

- The [Boilerform](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/boilerform) HTML/CSS framework for forms is aimed at making form creation less painful with ready-to-use form elements. If you want to know more about the background of this project, read [Andi Bell's article on CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/boilerform-a-follow-up/).

- Meta tags are an important part of your website. They enable search engines or social networks to display information about your website visually, thus providing more context for users. With [Hey Meta](http://www.heymeta.com), a browser based tool, you can both check and improve your website's meta tags.

- While the head element is the parent of all these meta tags, it can have a lot more children. [Head](https://gethead.info) is a guide to <head> elements with links for further reading.

- HTML 5.2 has brought the new dialog element. While its currently only supported in Chrome, other browsers will probably soon follow. A polyfill is available. Read more about the features of the new element and how to use it [in this article](https://keithjgrant.com/posts/2018/meet-the-new-dialog-element/).

- Naema Baskanderi discusses [best practices for creating usable and accessible dialog windows](https://heydesigner.com/blog/best-practices-modals-overlays-dialog-windows/).

## Performance

- Starting July 2018, Google will make page speed a ranking factor in mobile search results. While according to their [blog post](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/01/using-page-speed-in-mobile-search.html), relevant content will continue to rank high, developers should look into relevant metrics of website performance on mobile.

## This & That

- Lisa Wright wrote an interesting read on [why companies should say farewell to FAQs](https://alistapart.com/article/no-more-faqs-create-purposeful-information-for-a-more-effective-user-experi) in favor of a better content strategy.

- If you are interested in learning how to automate or scrape the web with JavaScript, e.g. take a screenshot of any website without actually visiting it, [this tutorial has a step by step introduction](https://codeburst.io/a-guide-to-automating-scraping-the-web-with-javascript-chrome-puppeteer-node-js-b18efb9e9921).

- [Threed](http://threed.io) allows you to generate 3D device mockups with your own designs in the browser. The tool is currently in beta and free.

- If you need a file uploader for your next project, you may want to consider [Uppy](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy). It seems to be a tool with a lot of interesting features. In any case, it's free and open source.
