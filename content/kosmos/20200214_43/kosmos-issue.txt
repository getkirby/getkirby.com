As we promised in our last issue, one of our goals for 2020 is to put a stronger focus on marketing Kirby–not only to strengthen our Kirby user family but to support you–users, developers or agencies when convincing clients that Kirby is the optimal choice for a project.

## Your Kirby Personal Demo is here

As a major step in this direction, here comes [Kirby demo](https://getkirby.com/try): discover Kirby instantly without installing. The demo features multiple site types integrated into a single site, showcasing the extreme flexibility of Kirby for your projects–big or small. As a demo user, access the Panel and explore Kirby's user-friendly editing interface: add blog posts, create new products, upload images to the gallery, edit and add users, and more. Check it out and let us know what you think! And if you are curious to know how we made it, visit the [repo on GitHub](https://github.com/getkirby/demokit).

## Kirby tip of the month

Did you know you can leverage the full power of (link: docs/guide/content/text-formatting text: KirbyText) in info sections/info fields or help text and even combine that with (link: docs/guide/blueprints/query-language text: Kirby's query language)? In the example below, we insert a KirbyText link tag and dynamically add the page URL.

```yaml
fields:
  info:
  label: Event Schema
  type: info
  text: >
    After saving, use the (link: https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool#url={{ page.url }} text: Google Structured Data Testing Tool) to verify the schema.
```

## Images

[FLIF](https://flif.info/)is a lossless image format that claims to be superior to PNG, lossless WebP, lossless BPG and lossless JPEG 2000 in terms of compression ratio on a variety of inputs. Currently, a polyfill is needed for using the format in the browser.

Progressively enhance image placeholders once they are in the viewport with the [`<progressive-image>`](https://github.com/andreruffert/progressive-image-element) custom element.
