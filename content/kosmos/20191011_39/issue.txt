Here we are again with episode 39.

With summer gone on our side of the globe, the team is working with energy on the next Kirby feature release (3.3), which is planned for around the end of October. In the meantime, we published [Kirby 3.2.5](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.2.5) with a pretty impressive list of improvements and fixes.

Thanks a lot to [Ahmet Bora](https://github.com/afbora) who's been supporting us a lot with fixing bugs and implementing features recently.

Also, the [Editor](https://github.com/getkirby/editor) is taking shape and getting ready for release, with better image uploading, more tests, and better parsers.

## Kirby plugins

++++

Manage your translation processes right from the Panel with the [Kirby Memsource plugin](https://github.com/OblikStudio/kirby-memsource) and the [Memsource TMS](https://www.memsource.com).

(â€¦columns)

Profile your Kirby CMS code with precision using the [Kirby Stopwatch plugin](https://github.com/bnomei/kirby3-stopwatch).

The [Kirby Spreadsheet plugin](https://github.com/texnixe/kirby3-spreadsheet) provides a `(spreadsheet:)` KirbyTag that reads a given spreadsheet and renders it as a table. More functionality like creating pages or virtual pages will be added in the next release.

<small>Always test third-party plugins thoroughly before using them in production.</small>

## Kirby tip of the month

Did you know there is a shortcut for adding fields to a blueprint by using the field type as key and `true` as value? Instead of simply setting it to `true`, you can set other options like the label, without having to specify the field type. Keep in mind that field names can only be used once per blueprint, so there is a natural limit to being lazyðŸ˜‰.

```yaml
fields:

  tags: true
  url: true
  text:
    label: Caption
```

## Cookbook

We went into the kitchen and came out with a new recipe. [Kirby in a nutshell](https://getkirby.com/docs/cookbook/setup/kirby-in-a-nutshell) is a round-up of things you may want to consider and questions to ask yourself when you start building your first (or second, orâ€¦) Kirby project.

## Quote of the month

> "JS is the web's CO2, and we should start asking why the biggest polluters aren't cleaning up their respective acts. Loudly. Insistently. Even when that's uncomfortable."
