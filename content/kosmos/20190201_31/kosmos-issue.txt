##Kirby Plugins

- Blanko GmbH ported their [Git (GCAPC) plugin](https://github.com/blankogmbh/kirby-git-commit-and-push-content/tree/kirby3) to Kirby 3. It commits and pushes changes made via the Panel in the content folder to a remote repo.

- While Kirby comes with its own database class, if you are looking for something more powerful, the [Kirby DB plugin](https://github.com/beebmx/kirby-db) adds support for the Illuminate\Database class.

- The [Kirby 3 Markdown Editor](https://github.com/sylvainjule/kirby-markdown-field) is a beautiful community built textarea field with visual cues and enhanced markdown features.

- Find all plugins in the [Kirby plugins repo](https://github.com/texnixe/kirby-plugins/issues). As a plugin dev, don't forget to add your plugin to the list.

<small>Always test third-party plugins thoroughly before using them in production.</small>

## Kirby Themes

- I counted 13 themes newly created or updated for Kirby 3 on [https://getkirby-themes.com](https://www.getkirby-themes.com). Check them out and expect more to come soon.

## Performance

- The article [Bandwidth or Latency: When to Optimise for Which](https://csswizardry.com/2019/01/bandwidth-or-latency-when-to-optimise-which/) shares a DevTools tip to work out which of those two options would benefit performance more.

##CSS
