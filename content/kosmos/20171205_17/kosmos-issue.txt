## Kirby Enhanced

- If you want to start using Gulp but don't know where to begin, then Martin Folker's [Gulp-Kirby-Starterkit](https://github.com/S1SYPHOS/Gulp-Kirby-Starter-Kit) might be just the right starting point for your next Kirby project (free). 

- [Rokka](https://rokka.io) is an online service for storing and delivering images for the web. Their [Rokka Kirby plugin](https://github.com/rokka-io/rokka-kirby-plugin) makes it easy to leverage this service in a Kirby website (free, alpha, paid account required).

- Martin Folkers also added [Kirby SRI](https://github.com/S1SYPHOS/kirby-sri) to our growing list of Kirby plugins. It generates [SRI hashes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) for safer usage of stylesheets and scripts with CDNs (free).

- Tired of having to log into the Panel all the time during development? It's time for [Kirby Autologin](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-autologin) to the rescue (free). 

- [Kirby Stompt](https://github.com/stomt/stomt-kirby-extension) is a plugin for use with the [Stompt service](https://www.stomt.com). It allows you to collect feedback from your website (plugin free, service requires account, free plan available).

Always test third party plugins thoroughly before using them in production!

## Kirby Tutorials

- Lauri Liimatta shares how to [create a simple event calendar](http://lauriliimatta.com/blog/how-to-create-simple-event-calendar-for-kirbycms) with Kirby. 

- Learn [how to build a photo collection](http://paszternak.me/blog/kirby-photo-collection) with Adam Paszternak.

## Performance

- Every now and then, we have discussions about performance on the Kirby forum. Therefore I'd like to share [this video](https://vimeo.com/190834530) with you, although it is already a couple of months old. "Code that don't exist is infinitely performant and extremely easy to maintain and document", says Heydon Pickering. I love it how Heydon is really passionate about his case, so if you love swear words a lot, check it out :)

## Tables

- Tables are no images: Richard Rutter shares valuable insights into table design principles in [his article on A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/article/web-typography-tables).

## Email

To style or not to style, that is the question.

- Greg Kogan underpins his [claims not to style emails in this article](https://www.gkogan.co/blog/dont-design-emails/) with numbers from his A/B testing experiments.

- If you come to the conclusion you'd rather style your emails anyway or your client insists on it no matter what, the open source [HEML](https://heml.io) markup language might alleviate the task.

## This and That

- David Dias shares his Resources for frontend beginners(https://github.com/thedaviddias/Resources-Front-End-Beginner) and a frontend checklist(https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Checklist). 

- [Sonar](https://github.com/sonarwhal/sonar), "a linting tool for the web", integrates other tools and services, like [aXe](https://www.deque.com/products/axe/) for accessibility, or the [SSL Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/), and more. There's also an online service available [here](https://sonarwhal.com/scanner). 

- [https://gethead.info) is a useful guide to <head> elements.

- [accessibility.js](https://github.com/github/accessibilityjs) is an open source client side script that helps with finding accessibility errors like missing alt attributes in image tags or missing labels.

- The [HTTPie](https://httpie.org) command line HTTP client aims to make CLI interaction with HTTP servers, RESTful APIs, and web services really easy.

- And [fresh from Chris Coyier](https://css-tricks.com/css-attr-function-got-nothin-custom-properties/) on CSS-Ticks: How to pass data from HTML elements to CSS via attributes.
