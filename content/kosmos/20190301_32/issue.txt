How time flies. Four years ago to the day‚Äìon March 1, 2015‚Äìwe started our Discourse-based Kirby forum that replaced the earlier Kirby-based forum. It has grown ever since to become the friendly and lively Kirby community so many of you appreciate and love to come to üç∞.

At the beginning of last week, we published Kirby 3.0.2 with lots of fixes. This week, we have published the [RC for the upcoming 3.0.3 release](https://forum.getkirby.com/t/3-0-3-rc-2-is-here/13091/4) and we'd love you to test this pre-release locally in your projects if you can. The final 3.0.3 release is scheduled for Tuesday. The next feature release 3.1 is planned for March, 19th and will have some nice surprises.

The German [PC Magazin](https://www.pc-magazin.de/)'s issue 4/2019, which is published today, has an extensive introductory article about Kirby 3 and also features some popular plugins. They even plan to publish a follow-up article in an upcoming issue.

Georg Obermayr, a self-declared Kirby enthusiast, has written [a great article about cloud publishing](https://publisher.ch/fachzeitschrift_detail.php?t=Die%2BWolken%2Bverbinden&read_article=10941&t=Die%20Wolken%20verbinden) that brings together all the loose ends and goes into great detail what a modern publishing workflow could be like, using the "best in class" tools. If you don‚Äôt speak German, throw it onto [deepl.com](https://www.deepl.com/translator) or your translation tool of choice, the article is well worth a read.

## Kirby Plugins

The [Kirby XSLT](https://github.com/hananils/kirby-xslt) plugin brings XSLT templating to your Kirby installation. It generates XML for all front-end pages, allowing you to transform these XML nodes to any other structure.

Managing translations becomes a breeze with the [Kirby 3 Translations](https://github.com/flokosiol/kirby-translations/tree/kirby3)‚Äã plugin. The plugin is currently still in development, but your feedback is highly appreciated.

The [Kirby 3 Instagram](https://github.com/bnomei/kirby3-instagram) plugin allows you to call Instagram API endpoints.

Find related pages or files based on field content with the [Kirby 3 Related](https://github.com/texnixe/kirby3-related) plugin.
