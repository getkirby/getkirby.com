## Kirby Plugins

- Florens Verschelde has released a first beta of his [Kirby Twig](https://github.com/fvsch/kirby-twig/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta1) plugin for all developers who prefer to use the Twig template language over PHP.

- With two page lock plugins available for Kirby you now have the freedom of choice: [Kirby Page Lock plugin by Taikonauten](https://github.com/taikonauten/kirby-page-lock-plugin) and [Kirby Page Lock plugin by Pedro Borges](https://github.com/pedroborges/kirby-pagelock).

- [Kirby Constructs](https://github.com/lord-executor/kirby-constructs) is a new plugin by Lukas Angerer that lets you define constructs as a set of components that form a logical unit. A [sample construct](https://github.com/lord-executor/kirby-constructs-sample) and a [Starterkit](https://github.com/lord-executor/kirby-constructs-starterkit) are also available.

- Embed tables from Excel or .csv files right into your text fields with the [Kirby Spreadsheet](https://github.com/texnixe/kirby-spreadsheet) kirbytag by Sonja Broda. The plugin can also be used to render tables from files in your templates.

- Language selection and code highlighting are the key features of the Kirby [Code Field](https://github.com/taikonauten/kirby-code-field) by Taikonauten.

- If you are looking for a newsletter solution, check out [Red Chimp](https://github.com/bugsysop/red-chimp) by Aris Papathéodorou, a modular Kirby newsletter template that produces reponsive HTML emails.

- As a [Laravel Mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix) user, you will probably like the [Laravel Mix Kirby plugin](https://github.com/Diverently/laravel-mix-kirby) by Robert Cordes that helps to get the right path to your versioned CSS and JS files.

## Case Studies
- The new Siroop website uses a mix of technologies with Kirby in the backend and is thus another great example how you can build complex websites with Kirby in the most flexible ways. [Read about it here](http://made.ginetta.net/siroop-jobs.html).
