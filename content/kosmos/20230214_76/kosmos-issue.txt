The past week has been overshadowed by the tragic earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, which have so far killed well over 30,000 people and left many more injured and homeless. Our team member Ahmet and his family are safe and far away from the affected regions, but he is helping his city council organize donations - food, heaters and clothes - for the victims.

The least we as a company could do was donate, and we would like to encourage you to do the same - any small amount counts.
