If you missed it, or haven't moved your licenses yet, check your emails or just head over to our [website](https://getkirby.com/new-company) to learn more.


## Kirby 3.6.3

[Kirby 3.6.3](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.6.3) comes with some bug fixes, but as always, we managed to sneak in a few nice enhancements, like our new base URL setup, improved ImageMagick performance, an improved table block preview and more.

## Kirby plugins


The list of new plugins this time is rather long, and this selection is far from complete. A huge shout-out to all plugin devs.

[Kirby Charts](https://codeberg.org/Fundevogel/kirby3-charts) is a wrapper around [SVGGraph](https://github.com/goat1000/SVGGraph): create SVG Graphs with almost no limits.


The [Conditional Blocks](https://github.com/rasteiner/conditionalblocks) plugin disables blocks in layout fields when the column width does not match the block requirements.

[Translation status](https://github.com/doldenroller/k3-translation-status) provides an overview of the current translation status of your pages in a multi-language setup via an info section.

Apply micro-typographic rules to texts with the [Kirby Typographer](https://github.com/hananils/kirby-typographer)
plugin.

The [Punctuation section](https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirby-punctuation-section) is a nice little helper, from which clients can quickly copy commonly used characters to the clipboard and insert into their texts.

The [Move Pages](https://clicktonext.com/plugins/move-pages) plugin provides a feature many of you might have been missing: let clients move pages between allowed parent pages.

## A new newsletter service

This is our first Kosmos issue going out to all the subscribers who migrated their subscription to our new company. Thank you so much for your support! We used this chance for a fresh start and moved from
Campaign Monitor to Newstroll. [Newstroll](https://newstroll.de) is a more privacy-friendly newsletter service from Germany. They offer far more control over tracking combined with EU-based hosting. We are really happy so far, but let us know if you discover any issues with our emails: support@getkirby.com [mailto:support@getkirby.com)


## Frontend

[Locomotive Scroll](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/locomotive-scroll) provides smooth scrolling with support for parallax effects, toggling classes, and triggering event listeners when elements are in the
viewport.

Responsive images are a topic that comes up regularly. Not only should they look great on any device, but also load fast and transfer no more data than necessary. The use-case article [Big Images, blazingly fast](https://engineering.q42.nl/optimizing-full-screen-images/) looks into the limitations of `srcset` and `sizes` and alternatives.


## Tools


[fluxx](https://fffuel.co/ffflux/)  is an SVG generator for creating fluid blurred gradient backgrounds.

[jless](https://jless.io/) is a command-line JSON viewer designed for reading, exploring, and searching through JSON data.


## Privacy/GDPR


With a recent [court ruling](https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/german-court-rules-websites-embedding.html) saying that website owners who embed Google fonts are violating GDPR, it becomes a must to self-host those fonts. The [google-webfonts helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) makes abiding by the law real easy, and you gain [control over your fonts](https://css-irl.info/a-reason-to-self-host-fonts/) .


## This & that

[Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html): An Open Source JavaScript Visualization Library that supports an impressive amount of data viz types.

[php-svg](https://github.com/meyfa/php-svg) is a library for generating, modifying or transforming vector graphics in PHP.

[shellfirm](https://github.com/kaplanelad/shellfirm) will intercept any risky patterns in your terminal with a small challenge that will double-check if you really want to execute your action.

With [action-validator](https://cipherstash.com/blog/2021-11-25-linting-your-github-actions) you can lint your GitHub action YAML files for any errors before pushing them to GitHub.
