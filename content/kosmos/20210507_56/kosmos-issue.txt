Welcome to issue 56 of our Kosmos newsletter.

In case you missed it: we released Kirby [3.5.4](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.4) last week with an important security update that fixes potential XSS attacks from uploaded SVG or XML files. For details, check out our [security advisory](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-qgp4-5qx6-548g).

On Tuesday, we published [RC-1 for Kirby 3.5.5 with cool new features](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.5-rc.1) like a refactored video KirbyTag, controlling cache expiry from controllers, improvements for the blocks field, and a lot more.

## Kirbyverse

In an enlightening—albeit German—video published by [publishingNETWORK](https://www.vsd.ch/publishingNetwork/), Georg Obermayr talked about the ["Content First" approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeDOGvVQWFM) they implemented for [LOWA](https://lowa.de/), the outdoor boots company. We are very happy and excited that we are going to run a new [Stay Curious event on June 2nd](https://beyondtellerrand.com/stay-curious/content-first) with Georg & Bastian. This will give us the chance to talk a lot more about the Kirby specifics there and will be an opportunity to ask any questions you might have. The event will be free and in English and there will be a recording for anyone who cannot attend the live show.

## Kirby in the wild

Websites created with Kirby out in the wild are always a great source of inspiration and show that with its flexibility and extensibility there are hardly any limits to what you can create with Kirby.

## Privacy

[FLoC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_Learning_of_Cohorts) is Google's new way to support their business model by tracking people's behavior right in the browser without the need for 3rd-party cookies. You can read more about the background and how to opt-out [in this Plausible article](https://plausible.io/blog/google-floc), and you can find out if you are already part of a [cohort](https://amifloced.org/) here (currently, this new tracking technology is not implemented in countries with GDPR in place).

There's also [an article by Rohan Cumar](https://seirdy.one/2021/04/16/permissions-policy-floc-misinfo.html) that tries to demystify some recommendations around FLoC opt-out options.

One day, bundlers will hopefully be a thing of a dark past. In the meantime, if you have to learn webpack for some reason or another, check out this [Webpack step-by-step-tutorial for beginners](https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/webpack-tutorial-for-beginners/).

## This & That

While Apache is probably still the most used web server, more and more web applications today run on nginx. If you want to get familiar with this web server software, check out the free [Nginx Handbook](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-nginx-handbook/).

[Hash & manifest](https://github.com/adamkiss/hash-and-manifest) is a tool created by Adam Kiss that renames asset files in a directory to their hashed versions and generates a configurable manifest file.

A free [MOOC about design systems](https://thegymnasium.com/design-systems) with Ethan Marcotte covers topics like working with pattern libraries, user experience design and design tokens.

While writing SQL queries is probably not our main concern when working with a flat file CMS like Kirby, getting information out of databases is still something that is often necessary. [SQL Best Practices](https://www.metabase.com/learn/building-analytics/sql-templates/sql-best-practices) has some tips for writing better queries.

Short read why [storing a timestamp in place of a boolean value](https://changelog.com/posts/you-might-as-well-timestamp-it) is often preferable and provides more meaning to data.
