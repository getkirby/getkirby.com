Somehow, here we are again — another year almost over. This time of the year always feels like an in-between state to me: the old hasn’t quite passed, and the new hasn’t fully begun. But it's also the time to reflect what's happened, and make plans for what’s ahead (like planning new bicycle trips 🚲). And with that spirit of looking ahead, it’s the perfect moment to share with you our latest Kirby release, a first sneak peek of Kirby 6 for plugin devs, and lots of other news.


## Kirby 5.2.0 is here

[Kirby 5.2](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/5.2.0) comes with a pretty long changelog. Here are the highlights:

*   🐘 PHP 8.5 support
*   📻 CORS support
*   ☑️ New `batch` select mode for the checkboxes field
*   ↕️ Collapse / expand all blocks
*   📂 New `create` option for the files section
*   🏷️ Better auto-labels in the Panel
*   ⚡️ Big performance boost for forms

Head over to the [changelog](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/5.2.0) to explore the full list.

## Kirby 6 developer preview

We are planning to release Kirby 6 in the second half of 2026, but we need support from our plugin developer community early on. That's why we give you early access to [Kirby 6.0.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/6.0.0-alpha.1) today, and would like your feedback regarding any issues you run into.

One of the biggest (and long-awaited) changes in Kirby 6 is the upgrade of the Panel from Vue 2 to Vue 3. While this brings major improvements and new possibilities, it also means that all Panel plugins will need to be recompiled for compatibility, and some might even need changes under the hood.

**Note:** This developer preview does not include any visible interface changes or new features. It is intended only for plugin developers. Versions with features relevant to the broader community will begin rolling out in 2026.

## This & That

In [When AI will browse the web for me](https://www.stefanjudis.com/notes/when-ai-will-browse-the-web-for-me), Stefan Judis argues that as AI‑powered browsers and agents become more common, we risk losing direct access to the open web. Unseen filtering, corporate agendas, and algorithmic curation gradually replaces the “raw” web and undermines diversity of voices.

[Auth0: An Accessible Guide to  – Authentication Without Frustration](https://auth0.com/blog/an-accessible-guide-to-wcag-3-3-8-authentication-without-frustration/) shows how login flows can unintentionally exclude users with cognitive disabilities and recommends designing authentication that doesn’t rely on memory, transcription, or puzzles.

Adrian Roselli argues that no website or technology can ever be truly “[accessible to everyone](https://adrianroselli.com/2025/12/you-cant-make-something-accessible-to-everyone.html),” because people’s needs and contexts vary too much. Accessibility should therefore always be seen as a best-effort compromise rather than an absolute guarantee.

Agung Putra Pasaribu compares [PHP’s built-in json\_decode() with the JSON Machine library](https://agungpp.medium.com/decoding-large-json-files-efficiently-in-php-json-decode-vs-streaming-with-json-machine-b90273e09aba) for handling large JSON files. It shows that while json\_decode() is faster, streaming with JSON Machine drastically reduces memory usage, making it ideal for processing big data efficiently.

The first part of [A pracmatic guide to modern CSS colours](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-pragmatic-guide-to-modern-css-colours-part-one/) explores how modern CSS color syntax and new color spaces create a more flexible and intuitive way to define colors on the web. The [second part](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-pragmatic-guide-to-modern-css-colours-part-two/) shows how these capabilities come together in practical design systems, from theming workflows to more accessible, consistent color palettes.

[Field Sizing in CSS](https://ishadeed.com/article/field-sizing/) introduces the new \`field-sizing: content\` property, which allows form fields to automatically adjust to their content for more flexible layouts.

[PHP 8.5: The Silent Revolution That Transforms Your Code](https://nicolas-dabene.fr/en/articles/2025/11/16/php-8-5-silent-revolution-transforms-your-code/) explains how PHP 8.5 delivers over 40 practical improvements: From a new pipe operator and \`clone with\` syntax to mandatory OPcache and better error backtraces, it makes code more expressive, efficient, and secure without breaking backward compatibility.
