## Kirby 3.6 is here

After seven months of hard work, we are happy to announce that Kirby 3.6 is finally here. It comes with a ton of exciting new features that will make both users and developers happy. And it paves the way for more great features to come in the next releases. Especially, the Panel profits from a reduced JS bundle size and has become much more performant. Here are some highlights:

(columns…)

**Cardlets:** The missing link between cards and list layouts for pages and files sections and pages, files and users fields.

++++

**New views:** The settings view has been replaced with separate system and language views. The system view provides useful information about your setup.

**WebP & AVIF image formats:** Convert your images to modern, performant image formats on the fly.

++++

**Lots of new icons**: Use our Panel icon set to visually enhance the Panel interface for your users.

**Copy & paste for blocks:** You can now copy and paste blocks between block fields, and even create blocks from pasted HTML and text.

**Panel CSS properties** can now be used throughout the Panel and in every plugin. Now, it's even easier to style the Panel for your users in your [custom Panel stylesheet](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/system/options/panel#custom-panel-css).

++++


**New line block**, which automatically supports and imports `hr` blocks from the old Editor plugin.

**New slug field:** perfect for creating sanitized strings for IDs, URL paths, CSS class names, etc.

**More power for blocks and layouts with extensions:**

- Block model
- Block & blocks methods
- Layout & layouts methods

By popular request: **Configurable navigation option** that lets you configure how users can move between content with the prev/next navigation buttons.

(…columns)

We cannot possibly list all new features here. Discover them all in our [release notes](https://getkirby.com/releases/3.6/) and in the updated docs.

## Cookbook

To accompany the new areas feature (which replaces the former views), we have written a brand-new recipe: [“My first Panel area”](https://getkirby.com/docs/cookbook/panel/first-panel-area).

## Kirby Plugins

[IndieConnector](https://github.com/mauricerenck/indieConnector) is a Kirby Webmention plugin to receive (and soon send) webmentions. It replaces the former [Tratschtante](https://github.com/mauricerenck/tratschtante) plugin.

Visualize the site/logs folder in the panel with [Kirby LogBook](https://github.com/bvdputte/kirby-logbook). Opinionated defaults to work best with the [Kirby Log plugin](https://github.com/bvdputte/kirby-log/).

[Elephant](https://github.com/bnomei/kirby3-php-cachedriver) is a highly performant PHP Cache Driver for Kirby.

Most plugins affected by breaking changes in Kirby 3.6 have already been updated to work with the new release. You can check out their current compatibility status in our [list on GitHub](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/issues/3485).

<small>Note that we do not test plugins we list here. Therefore, always test third-party plugins thoroughly before using them in production.</small>
