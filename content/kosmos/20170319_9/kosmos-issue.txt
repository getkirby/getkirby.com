I just counted 28 new plugins and extensions since our last Kosmos episode. Unbelievable! I can't possibly list them all here, but if you head over to [Jens' and John's plugin repo](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-plugins), you can see for yourself. Also, we had well over 210k page views in the Forum last month and countless new websites powered by Kirby. What a community!

## Powered by Kirby

Its always inspiring to see what others are creating with Kirby. This month’s picks are again very different and very unique:

## Kirby Plugins

Out of the many new plugin mentioned above, I have selected a few you might like:

- Pedro Borges, creator of the popular [AutoGit](https://github.com/pedroborges/kirby-autogit) plugin, has come up with two new plugins. Create a Tachyons-styled, human readable XML sitemap for search engines with the [XML sitemap](https://github.com/pedroborges/kirby-xml-sitemap) plugin or use the [Meta Tag](https://github.com/pedroborges/kirby-open-graph) plugin to create Open Graph and Twitter cards meta tags for your site in a simple way.

- The [ImageOptim API](https://github.com/ImageOptim/php-imageoptim-api) recently came out of beta, and now Bruno Meilick has created the [Kirby Imageoptim](https://github.com/bnomei/kirby-imageoptim) plugin that leverages this API via a simple file method. He also just published a couple of other plugins, including a [KirbyTag to generate various random values](https://github.com/bnomei/kirby-random).

- Compress Kirby's output with Jurriaan Topper's [Kirby Compress](https://github.com/iksi/KirbyCompress) plugin. It strips all whitespace between html tags but leaves the whitespace inside `<style>`,`<script>`, `<pre>` and `<textarea>` tags untouched.

- [Papeterie](https://github.com/louis-ev/Papeterie) is a Kirby plugin by Louis Eveillard that lets you create and edit paper documents through Kirby.

- Adding likes (and even dislikes) to a post or page becomes a breeze with Jens Törnell's latest creation, the [Kirby Nja](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-nja) plugin.
