## Kirby Plugins

- The Kirby (link: https://github.com/LCD344/kirby-mailer-wrapper text: Mailer Wrapper plugin) by LCD344 provides a class that adds a wrapper around all Kirby mail drivers and provides two new drivers, a log driver and a PHPMailer driver.
- (link: https://github.com/jongacnik/spad text: Spad) is a Kirby plugin by Jon Gacnik, which adds a new site method to Kirby that exposes your site data as JSON. These data can then be used, for example, in a single page app or any other project that can make use of JSON data .
- Jens "Plugin Machine" Tornell strikes again with two new plugins: The (link: https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-keyword-density text: Keyword Density Plugin) targets users who want to optimize their content for search engines, while the (link: https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-panel-brand text: Panel Brand bar) helps developers to identify different environments (e.g. development/production).
- Language variables usually live in their language files and cannot be edited via the Panel. The (link: https://github.com/rasteiner/kirbytranslations text: Kirby Translations plugin) by Roman Steiner allows Panel users to edit these languages variables in an easy way.

## Tools

- Emanuel Kluge developed an HTML to KirbyText converter that is available as both (link: https://github.com/herschel666/html-to-kirbytext text: a tool you can install on your server)​ as well as an (link: https://html-to-kirbytext-website.now.sh text: online service). Try it out.

## Cookbook

- August Miller contributed an extensive recipe to the Kirby cookbook: learn how to (link: https://getkirby.com/docs/cookbook/deploying-with-capistrano text: deploy Kirby with Capistrano), an open-source deployment tool. Check it out!

## Javascript

- (link: https://github.com/Nickersoft/push.js text: Push.js) is a cross-browser solution for desktop notifications, which provides a fallback to older implementations if the browser does not support the new JavaScript Notification API.

## Security

- Beginning in January 2017 with the release of Chrome 56, Google will start to mark all HTTP websites that collect passwords or credit cards as non-secure. This will come as a first step in a series of measures intended to make the web more secure by raising awareness for the lack of security of HTTP connections. (link: https://blog.chromium.org/2016/09/moving-towards-more-secure-web.html text: Time to switch to HTTPS as soon as possible).

## IoT

- Web Bluetooth is a technology that allows a website to communicate with nearby Bluetooth devices. The Web Bluetooth API is available in Chrome 53 as an Origin trial for Chrome OS, Android M, and Mac. (link: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/07/interact-with-ble-devices-on-the-web text: This tutorial) gets you started with using this experimental feature.

## Fonts

- Google has released a new open source font family called Noto, which aims to support all writing systems both living and historical. Noto fonts come in different styles and weights. Check them out at https://www.google.com/get/noto/.
