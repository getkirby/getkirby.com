Only two weeks after the last Kosmos episode, here we are again. But there's are good reasons for this, and that's not only our sale… but read on…

## Kirby 4.1.2


Last week, we released [Kirby 4.1.2](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/4.1.2) and it's all about bug fixes. If you are not affected by any of the bugs we fixed, there is of course no need to update.

## Kirby learning


[Panel tricks: Let's build a bookmark tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC9Up05WVnI)
Basti shows how to use table layout and a customized page creation dialog to build a categorized and searchable link collection in the Panel.

[Models: Superpowers for your pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5DS2njIvDs) 
This one picks up where the bookmark tool screencast ends. As the title suggests, it's all about page models and how to use them to improve our bookmark tool even more.


## Kirby plugins

[Kirby SEO Audit](https://kirbyseo.com/) brings the power of Yoast SEO to a Kirby Panel section. Improve your content and boost your rankings by checking your pages for SEO issues.


## Kirby docs

We overhauled our docs to (hopefully) make it easier to find your way around:

*   We removed the overview page from the [guide](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide), so you can jump right in.
*   Each guide page got a prev/next navigation at the end, so you can navigate between pages.
*   We moved shorter cookbook recipes to the new [Quicktips](https://getkirby.com/docs/quicktips) section which has a separate entry in the main menu.
*   The [Cookbook](https://getkirby.com/docs/cookbook) now looks a lot more inviting with a bit of color, a condensed overview, improved categories and additional tagging.
*   We introduced [tabbed sections](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/quickstart#installing-kirby) that allow us to condense content where appropriate for a better overview.
*   We moved some stuff out of the cookbook and into the guide to keep things that belong together together.

These are first steps in an attempt to consolidate stuff that has grown over the years. More to come in the near future.

A trivial performance optimization to help speed up third-party or other-origin requests is to [`preconnect` them](https://csswizardry.com/2023/12/correctly-configure-preconnections/): hint that the browser should preemptively open a full connection (DNS, TCP, TLS) to the origin in question.
