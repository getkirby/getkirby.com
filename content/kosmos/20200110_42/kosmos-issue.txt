Hope you all had a great start into 2020. We finished the last year with the release of Kirby 3.3.2 before the winter break, and are now picking up speed for 3.4, scheduled for some time in March.

## ðŸŽ« &nbsp;1. Kirby Konf: Get your ticket now

Only <del>10</del> 9 more weeks until our first Kirby "family gathering". Meet other Kirby developers & the team on [March 21st, 2020 in Mainz, Germany](https://getkirby.com/konf). Book your ticket now (there are only 50), and if you want, you can also register for the warm-up event the night before. Tickets are free, but you can support the event with an amount of your choice! *(Please, make sure to register even if you added yourself to the temporary Colloq page!)*

**Update 2019-01-20**: All tickets were sold within two days, but the waiting list is still open.

## Plans for 2020

A new year wouldn't be a new year without plans for the time ahead. So here are some cherry-picked plans and ideas we have for Kirby:

- More screencasts and videos
- A Kirby demo installation on our website
- A new Kirby Query Language API
- Live-Preview mode for the Panel
- An image editor for the Panel
- And more â€¦

Our list is in fact much longer, some things are already under way, but like in our own lives, some ideas might never see the light of day, new ideas will pop up instead, so take this for what it is, join the discussion and stay tuned.

## Kirby Workshop: Last call

## Kirby tip of the month

Panel sections with a card layout can have 3 types of background: `pattern`, `black` and `white`. You can easily add custom background colors, though:

```yaml
sections:
  pages:
    type: pages
    layout: cards
    image:
      query: page.images.findBy("name", "cover")
      cover: true
      ratio: 1/1
      back: rebeccapurple
```

Since Kirby adds this color to a `data-back` attribute, you can then add the following styles in a [custom Panel style sheet](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/system/options/panel#custom-panel-css) without having to override one of the default backgrounds:

```css
[data-back="rebeccapurple") span {
  background: rebeccapurple;
}
```

A similar approach will work for info sections or fields, if you prefer to have no background/border (a neutral theme will come in a future release) or use custom styles.

## ðŸ˜‹ &nbsp;Kirby Cookbook

As promised in the last newsletter, we have a new Cookbook recipe: [The power of placeholders](https://getkirby.com/docs/cookbook/extensions/use-placeholders) extends last month's Kirby tip to get the most out of this technique.

## Kirby plugins

The [Redis Cache driver plugin](https://github.com/bnomei/kirby3-redis-cachedriver) adds support for Redis to Kirby.

The [Focus plugin](https://github.com/flokosiol/kirby-focus) now comes with support for `srcset` and `presets`, making it much more versatile.

<small>Always test third-party plugins thoroughly before using them in production.</small>

## Usability

How many products should be in a product list when the page loads? When are fewer products better than more and vice versa? [A research article by Baymard Institute](https://baymard.com/blog/number-of-items-loaded-by-deafult) suggests that the ideal number depends on the type of product.
