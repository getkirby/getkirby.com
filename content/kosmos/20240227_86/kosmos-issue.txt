At times, when anti-democratic and anti-human sentiments are reaching a new high around the world, it is more important than ever to realize what’s at stake and to act, each of us in their capacity.

As the Kirby team, we not only see it as our responsibility as individuals, but also as a company to take a clear stance in favor of a diverse society and a free democracy. And not only with the power of words, but also financially. Starting today, for every purchased license, we will donate 1 Euro to the [Amadeu Antonio Foundation](https://www.amadeu-antonio-stiftung.de/en/) for their work on reinforcing a democratic civil society. If you want, you can match our donation during the checkout process.
