Here we are again with Kosmos issue 71. We are now already into our 7th year with this newsletter (yes, the first version was published on July 1st, 2016) and I still like preparing it and getting it out to you every single month, well almost.

## Security patch for versions 3.5.0 to 3.7.3

Unfortunately, we were made aware of a security issue, which was published in the open before we were given a chance to fix it.

We have released security patches for Kirby versions 3.5.0 up to 3.7.3. These releases ([3.5.8.1](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8.1), [3.6.6.1](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.6.6.1) and [3.7.4](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.7.4)) fix cross-site scripting (XSS) issues in the tags and multiselect fields. You can read more about the issues in the security advisories that are linked from the release notes of the respective patch releases. Please update your installations as soon as possible if you are possibly affected by this vulnerability.

## Kirby 3.7.4

Today, we release [Kirby 3.7.4](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.7.4) with a few interesting new features like HMR (Hot Module Reloading) for plugins that use [kirbyup](https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirbyup), a new `Helpers::handleErrors()` method for custom PHP error handling, and a new `F::unlink()` method for idempotent deletion of files and links. There are also some nice enhancements to check out in the changelog. This version is also the last 3.7.x release. We are now actively working towards Kirby 3.8.
