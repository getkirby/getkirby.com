Welcome to issue 55 of our Kosmos newsletter. We are a bit late this month, but we have sort of an excuse ;) Because last night was "big night"â€“at least for usâ€“because it was launch night ðŸš€!

After a lot of hard work and several design rounds, it's finally done: [We relaunched our website](https://getkirby.com) yesterday and hope you will like it.


The new website isn't just about a few design changes. The main idea was to tell a better story about what Kirby really is and can do for you as designers, developers, content creators or users.

But we also improved the guide and reference, made the search much easier to use with options to filter by the area on the site, added missing content and a lot more. But see for yourselves.


## Kirby in the wild

Websites created with Kirby out in the wild are always a great source of inspiration and show that with its flexibility and extensibility there are hardly any limits to what you can create with Kirby.

## Plugins & Kits

A couple of Kosmos issues ago, we mentioned the [Ray app](https://myray.app/) from Spatie as a way to debug your applications. Now there is a [helper tool](https://github.com/genxbe/kirby3-ray)for Kirby that enables Ray on all extendable methods.

Fetch instagram photos without the need for app aproval. The [Instagram plugin](https://github.com/genxbe/kirby3-instagram) will download the photos and/or video thumbnails to local storage. All media will be stored in a json file.

A new kid on the blocks: True to its name, the [Accordion Block](https://github.com/kiahreading/kirby-accordion-block) provides a semantic HTML accordion block for Kirby's blocks field.
