This episode marks the 6-month anniversary of Kirby Kosmos and the last one for this year. A lot has happened around Kirby and its vibrant community over the last half a year: a big Kirby release, a brand new Starterkit, tons of Kirby plugins and countless new Kirby powered sites. We are really thrilled with what you are creating.

## Powered by Kirby

Every month, a lot of great Kirby-powered websites are published. As always, we have selected three, each of them very unique:

## Kirby Plugins

- Micropub is an open API standard you can use to create posts on your own domain via a third party service. Sebastiaan Andeweg's [Micropub plugin](https://github.com/sebsel/kirby-micropub) adds Micropub support to Kirby as an endpoint.

- The [Srcset tag helper](https://gist.github.com/azharc/f9821c3c49185d9b06daf9ad7b23e968) by Azhar Chougle facilitates creating an image tag with srcset attribute by providing a helper function.

- Roman Steiner's [Controlled List](https://github.com/rasteiner/controlledlist) plugin adds new radio, select and checkboxes fields whose options can be defined via a user defined callback function.

- Keep track on what users changed in the Panel with the [Kirby Logger](https://github.com/texnixe/kirby-logger) plugin by Sonja Broda, which lists changes with timestamp, username, action and changed fields.

- Protect pages and files from unauthorized access right from the Panel with the [Kirby Firewall](https://github.com/dweidner/kirby-firewall) plugin by Daniel Weidner.

- [Quickselect](https://github.com/medienbaecker/kirby-quickselect) by Thomas Günther extends the native Kirby Panel select field with placeholder and filter functions.

- [Phinx for Kirby](https://github.com/ivinteractive/kirby-phinx) by IV Interactive is a Kirby CMS wrapper for migration and seed paths to be used with [Phinx](https://phinx.org), a command line tool for database migrations and seedings.

## CSS

- Browser support for grid is coming to more and more browsers, so if you want to spend a day getting to grips with these layout features, the [CSS Grid, Flexbox and Box Alignment](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/11/css-grids-flexbox-and-box-alignment-our-new-system-for-web-layout/) tutorial by Rachel Andrew might be a starting point.

Developer Tools

- Firefox Nightly DevTools now ship with a [network throttling tool](https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/2016/11/07/simulate-slow-connections-with-the-network-throttling-tool/), which let's you simulate slow connections to help you create websites that perform well across different devices and situations.

- Interested to learn more about using Chrome Dev Tools? Watch the [Debugging the Web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF1luRD4Qmk) video from the Chrome Dev Summit #16 with Paul Irish.

## Accessibility

- [Inclusive Design Patterns. Coding Accessibility into Web Design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/books/#inclusive-design-patterns), a new book by Heydon Pickering, looks "at common web interface patterns through the lens of inclusivity". It covers patterns from buttons to registration forms.

## Git

- The [Tower Git client](https://www.git-tower.com/windows) - a visual user interface for using git - is now available for Windows. By the way: Did you know the Tower website runs on Kirby?
