* Batch delete for structures
* Searchable info in multiselect fields
* Stats field as companion to the stats section

* [X‑Ray](https://plugins.getkirby.com/x-ray) — provides a comprehensive overview of the content present on your site and individual pages.
* [PHP Git Deploy](https://github.com/ianschoon/php-git-deploy) — a simple PHP webhook deployment system for GitHub repositories with SSH authentication and post‑deployment commands.
* [Kirby FTP Backup](https://github.com/getkirby/ftp-backup) — zips up your Kirby site content and uploads backups to your FTP server, with options for scheduled cron jobs and manual backups.
* [Mapnotator](https://github.com/getkirby/mapnotator) — annotate maps and generate GeoJSON in Kirby by drawing markers, paths, and shapes.
