There is so much interesting stuff going on in our industry: with browsers supporting more features seemingly on a daily basis, with the possibilities CSS opens up for designers ([and the crazy stuff people do with it](https://github.com/cyanharlow/purecss-francine)), with helpful tools for all sorts of problems, and a lot more.

## Fonts
- Variable fonts promise more flexibility regarding font attributes such as width, slant, x-height, slabs or rounding, facilitating responsive design on the typography layer. Examples of what you can do with variable fonts can be found [here](https://www.dstype.com/variable-fonts) and [here](http://fvar.unsoundscapes.com). [Browser support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=variable-fonts) is unfortunately still somewhat limited.

## JS
- [Micro.js](http://microjs.com) is a collection of small JavaScript frameworks and libraries that solve a single problem.

## CSS II

- [GridToFlex](http://www.gridtoflex.com) is a new open source project by Una Kravets. It provides flexbox fallbacks for CSS grid layouts. Participation welcome.

- Osvaldas Valutis wrote an article about [how to implement the "priority navigation pattern"](https://css-tricks.com/container-adapting-tabs-with-more-button/) using progressive enhancement to reduce the amount of JavaScript needed to the min.

## Forms

- Mary Lou shares an interesting idea for a [progressive hover effect on desktop](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2018/05/02/ideas-for-proximity-feedback-with-progressive-hover-effects/), for example to highlight errors in a form when the user approaches the submit button.

## This & That

- Heleen van Nues and Lennart Overkamp discuss the downsides of using wireframes and [how "priority guides" can help focus on the user and content](https://alistapart.com/article/priority-guides-a-content-first-alternative-to-wireframes).

(columns…)
[Dear Data](http://www.dear-data.com/theproject) is a beautiful project by Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec. Each week – over the period of a year – they sent each other postcards with visualizations of data related to their daily lives. Now available as a book.
