Summer is here, not just in the calendars of the Northern Hemisphere, but also in very real terms. But while that means it's hot outside (and our brains are slowly starting to melt), there's even hotter news: The long wait is over and — drum roll — we're proud to present Kirby 5.

## Kirby 5 is here
