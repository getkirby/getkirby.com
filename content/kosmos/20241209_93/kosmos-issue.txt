Here we are with the last issue of our newsletter in 2024. But before the year comes to an end, we want to update you with the latest news on Kirby 5, and you will get a last chance for this year to buy new licenses at a big discount.

On that note, enjoy the festive seasonüéÑ. The entire Kirby team wishes you and your loved ones a safe, healthy, and happy new year‚ú®. See you on the other side.

## üöÄ Kirby 5 ‚Äî Beta: A whole new editing experience

While we had planned to release Kirby 5 by the end of 2024, we decided to postpone it a bit to give it some more love, and instead present a first beta before the holidays. You can expect the final release early next year.

From previewing your unsaved changes to dark mode, from chunked uploads of large files to custom file previews, Kirby 5 brings a whole new editing experience to the Panel.

Check out [all the new features](https://getkirby.com/releases/5) and the preliminary [docs](https://getkirby.com/releases/5/changes).

Kirby 5 is a free upgrade for everyone with a valid [Kirby Basic or Enterprise license](https://getkirby.com/buy).

*Note that as a major release, Kirby 5 might require some changes to existing sites.*

## ü§ù For a good cause: new charity

This year, we started donating ‚Ç¨1 to a good cause for every license sold ‚Äì and your matching contributions have made a big difference!

Since November 21, our donations go to the Against Malaria Foundation, which provides bed nets to prevent malaria. This disease claims 625,000 lives each year, mostly children under five ‚Äì but it's preventable. Nets have already reduced cases by two-thirds.

With every license sold (and your match) we can fund one net to protect people: <https://www.againstmalaria.com/>

## üõ†Ô∏è Kirby 4.5.0

We also released Kirby 4.5.0, which comes with some nice enhancements and fixes.

Get it here: <https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/4.5.0>

Note that while PHP 8.4 was released a short while ago, we couldn't add support for it in 4.5.0 yet because we are waiting for updates of some dependencies. You can, however, expect PHP 8.4 support to come to Kirby 4.6.

## üîå New plugins

Our plugin directory grows with every issue, check out these new plugins:

- Enhance your site's social media presence with the [OG Image plugin](https://plugins.getkirby.com/mauricerenck/og-image). Dynamically generate [#OpenGraph](https://mastodon.social/tags/OpenGraph) images using customizable templates, ensuring each page has a unique and visually appealing preview.
