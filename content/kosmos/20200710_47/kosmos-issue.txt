Kirby 3.4 has probably the [longest changelog](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.4.0) since the release of Kirby 3. It's literally packed with new features and improvements. So get yourself a drink of your choice, sit down comfortably and have a good read. Or‚Äìand I think that's much more fun‚Äìquickly download the new release, and test all the new stuff right away. Don't forget to have a look at the few breaking changes. For the hooks, Lukas has created a migration-checker tool.

Here are a few of the many features:

- Wildcard hooks
- Extensible search
- Support for parentheses in KirbyTags
- Refactored Database, HTML and XML classes
- Extensible collection methods
- Custom plugin types
- ‚Ä¶

## New Editor releases

To keep Kirby 3.4 company, there's also a new version of the [Editor](https://github.com/getkirby/editor/releases/tag/1.0.4) with enhancements and fixes.


## ‚ù§Ô∏è Kirby in the wild 1

Websites created with Kirby out in the wild are always a great source of inspiration and show that with its flexibility and extensibility there are hardly any limits to what you can create with Kirby.

## üß© Kirby plugins

The list of new plugins is almost as long as the Kirby 3.4 changelog:

++++

The [Gallery block](https://github.com/cajames/kirby-editor-gallery-block) provides a gallery module for Kirby's Editor with lots of cool features like drag & drop arranging, auto-layout, render snippet, option to add classes and alt text to each image.

(‚Ä¶columns)

[Kirby Pay](https://github.com/beebmx/kirby-pay) offers a painless and easy way to create payments for Kirby.

[Kirby Inertia](https://github.com/monoeq/kirby-inertia) is an adapter for Inertia.js. It allows you to build your front end using Javascript (React, Vue and Svelte), while letting the server (in this case, Kirby) take care of routing and shaping data.

The [Kirby Webhook plugin](https://github.com/pju-/kirby-webhook-field) lets you trigger [webhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) from the Kirby Panel, for example to trigger a build or deploy mechanism.

The [Rollup Pluginkit](https://github.com/johannschopplich/rollup-pluginkit) is meant as an alternative to Kirby's Pluginkit that replaces Parcel.js with Rollup.js.

[Kirby Date Methods](https://github.com/hananils/kirby-date-methods) provides a set of field and page methods for formatting dates and creating PHP date objects.

[Kirby Conditional Snippets](https://github.com/hananils/kirby-snippetwhen-helper): a shortcut to only embed snippets when a given condition is met.

[Kirby Date Extended](https://github.com/Adspectus/k3-date-extended) creates additional date fields as epoch on page creation/update.

<small>Always test third-party plugins thoroughly before using them in production. Note that we do not test plugins we list here.</small>
