I was away on vacation in Italy for 10 days and tried to get away from MacBook & Co. as much as possible, only occasionally peeping in on what was happening back home. But hey, itâ€™s unbelievable how much can happen in such a short time span.

New nightly builds of the Kirby 3 beta are currently published on a daily basis while the developer community is joining forces to discuss and develop plugins we all would love to see for Kirby 3.

But while all this is happening [behind the scenes](https://getkirby.com/next), Kirby 2 is running strong with new plugins, the recent security update release 2.5.12 and - of course - new projects out in the wild.
